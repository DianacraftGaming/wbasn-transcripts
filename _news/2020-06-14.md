Changes: 

* It was pointed out to me over email that the transcript to [MAG072, Takeaway]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/072.html), was missing its supplemental section, so I went ahead and transcribed it.

* I've created fixed a variety of minor typos in episodes in [MAG001]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/001.html) through [MAG016]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/016.html), and also added links to Google Docs documents for them.

Episodes 1 through 16 are official transcripts, but since people who aren't comfortable using Github have been sending me corrections for them, I've decided to go ahead and start fixing small stuff. Assuming I have time, I'll be doing the same for more official episodes / unofficial transcripts by other people over the next few weeks.
