summary:         "Fixed attribution links for some transcripts"

Changelog:

* Corrected attribution links for transcripts prepared by __[anatomyhouse.tumblr.com](https://tmblr.co/molYyThmmvtsZ5OBctA3hnQ)__ (formerly __prentissed__) using a Tumblr-generated permalink, which should *hopefully* continue to work even in the event of future username changes. (This became an issue because someone else is now at prentissed.tumblr.com -- sorry, new-prentissed!)

* Where possible, also added hopefully-perma-links for other Tumblr users who have contributed transcripts.

Please [email me](mailto:snarp@snarp.work) if you run into any problems.
