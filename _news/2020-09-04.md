Changelog:

* Made some changes how the metadata for episodes is formatted, to make it easier for me to add and sort links in the episode headers. (The ones that say "PDF", "Google Doc", etc.) This shouldn't make the site look any different on the frontend, so please let me know if you spot any broken links or weird-looking lists.

Please [email me](mailto:snarp@snarp.work) if you run into any problems.
