Changelog:

* I'm in charge now.

* I will be presenting the *former* executive board of The Rusty Quill with an invoice for presenting these transcripts in a format that is accessible to screen readers, mobile devices, etc; for my own transcripts; and for my invaluable services in re associating TMA with Homestuck in the public mind.

* I am allowed to do this, because I'm in charge now.

* Company name will henceforth be "The Quill" due to liability issues (tetanus).
