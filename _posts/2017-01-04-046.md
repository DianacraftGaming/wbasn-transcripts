#### ARCHIVIST

#### ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

It's hard to know exactly where to begin when explaining to you what exactly it was that I experienced. There were many things that happened, each strange and inexplicable in and of itself, but I'll be damned if I can see how they connect to each other, except that they've all ended up involving the same student from the university.

His name was Michael Crew, though he normally went by Mike, at least to me. I'm not usually one to pay much attention to the students that come into my shop, especially during the start of a new school year. I have something of a soft spot for the antique when it comes to my furnishings, and that combined with the age of my stock means that when new students arrive at the university, they generally regard the discovery of Lion Street Books as something of a curiosity. I've heard more than one comparison to that shop in Stephen King's _Needful Things,_ whatever it was called.

Anyway, as I deal mostly in rare books and antiquities, they generally get one look at the prices and suddenly their interest dries up. Of course, there are always a couple of rich kids whose parents weren't able to buy their way into Oxbridge, so it's not a complete waste.

So it's rare that I have any cause to remember the face of my student customers. But Mike struck me the moment he walked into my shop. This would have been last September. I don't remember the exact date, though I'm sure if I looked up my receipts I could tell you. He was short, barely over 5 feet, and very thin. Underfed, I remember thinking. It hadn't yet turned cold, but he wore a high-collared coat and a thick scarf wrapped around his neck.

Now, I'm getting on in years and much as I love my shop, the building can get a bit drafty come autumn, so I generally have the heating up quite high. It was clearly enough for him to be uncomfortable, wrapped up like that, and he removed the scarf to reveal a branching pattern of white scar tissue arcing up the side of his neck.

That was interesting, certainly, but it wasn't what actually caught my eye. No, what struck me most was that, rather than wonder or curiosity, as I would see in the faces of the other students who found their way into Lion Street Books, this young man began scanning the shelves with an expression that seemed more like impatience. 

He was clearly looking for something specific, so after a few minutes I asked him if I could help. Without looking, up he said he was after a copy of de Plancy's _Dictionnaire Infernal_ - the older, the better.  I only had a 1908 translation in stock, but I said I would make enquiries if he wished for an older edition. He didn't reply to this, nor my casual inquiry as to whether he was studying demonology or the occult. He took it to my desk to buy it, and I started rooting around for the credit card machine when I smelled the strangest thing. It was like just before a storm breaks - that sharp smell in the air. But looking outside, the sky was clear and the sun was shining. 

Mike seemed to smell it, too, and he went very still. He reached into his jacket and pulled out a wad of cash. He quickly counted it out, grabbed the book, was through the door before I even had a chance to ring him up a receipt.

The smell faded as soon as he was out of sight. I didn't know his name at that point, but it was far from the last time I saw him. He became something of a regular. Maybe once every three weeks or so he'd come in and check any new stock I had. He was interested in spiritualism, history of witchcraft, anything mystical, especially from before 1850. He also bought a few books on meteorology, especially pre-enlightenment, and once a book on the work of Gottfried Leibniz, though I don't remember the title. 

I have no idea where he was getting his money, but he had a lot of it. He was able to pay five figures for a copy of a 1559 printing of the _Malleus Maleficarum_ without breaking a sweat.

At some point, I learned his name. 

I mean, I certainly wouldn't have described him as a friend, or even close, 

but over the last year he had easily been my most regular customer. 

That wasn't the only time I smelled that acrid tang in the air, though. Sometimes when he was in there, it would come again, all at once. It never seemed to be coming from Mike, exactly, but when he was around 

the smell would just suddenly be there.

It was the only time I would ever smell it inside, and when I did, Mike would just stop whatever he was doing and leave 

him

easily

He wouldn't run, he'd just leave.

There was another thing, too. Whenever he was in, the lightbulbs in my shop would burn brighter. I didn't even realize this until he'd been coming for several months, as it was usually in daylight when he went shopping. But when winter made its presence known, his late afternoon visits began to take place after dark, and I noticed that whenever he came in, the shop got brighter. The bulbs would start to buzz very softly, 

and the ovens within them would glow with a surprising intensity.

There was this strange electric crackling. Once I even got a shock when I turned a lamp on. 

I never brought it up with Mike, though. I don't even know how I would have gone about bringing it up.

It was February when I got the Leitner book. I'd heard of him before, of course, though I'd never met the man. The rare book trade is a comparatively small world, at least within the UK, and his name would often come up whenever I was gossiping with my peers. Sometimes it was about which valuable piece he'd snatched for a fraction of its true value, or the ridiculous amount he'd paid for a book that everyone else was sure was a fake. Occasionally, there were more-unsavory rumors about his personal life. 

So even though I'd never personally made his acquaintance, I was well aware of Jurgen Leitner and his collection. And when he disappeared in 1994, I was one of the many that heard whispers on the grapevine that a few of his books were back in circulation. 

I never thought I'd actually get my hands on one, though. not

until I heard about Karstens death

Kirstin Bauman was a book dealer friend

of mine down in Salisbury I suppose you

could call her arrival in some ways but

we'd always been very friendly in fact

there were a few years back in the 80s

when we were very friendly indeed but we

hadn't spoken much in the last year or

two well in January of this year she

passed away lost balance on the stairs

and broke her neck to be honest I wasn't

as surprised by her death as I might

have been though it was rather alarming

over the last few years the landscape of

the UK rare books trade has changed

significantly a lot of the big names in

the old guard of gone missing or retired

or sometimes even been found dead the

police even got involved for a while as

there was talk of maybe someone out

there targeting booksellers but they

never found anything to indicate it was

anything other than a coincidence I

suppose it's just an example of how one

generation inevitably makes way for the

next but Kirsten was the first time it

had affected someone I knew well what

surprised me more than her death however

was that she had made me her literary

executor and left me the vast majority

of her stock so it was I came into the

possession of a Leitner it was a

strange one all right Excel T aura or

from the heights was the name he was

custom bound in the late 1800s from what

I could see though the pages looked to

be significantly older than that 17th

century I would have said it was written

in Latin and seemed to be a long poem in

the style of Virgil illustrated with

some quite striking wood cuts it told

the tale of a small unnamed town high on

a cliff top that sees a monstrous

creature begin to approach the poem is

unclear whether it is a beast a demon or

of God as it uses the words

interchangeably but it is seen far off

its head and body lost among the clouds

the majority of the story details the

villagers attempts to prepare to do

battle against this creature but each

time they devise a countermeasure the

thing gets closer and is shown to be far

larger than previously suspected

rendering that prepper

relations insignificant at last when it

is almost upon them it's impossible

vastness undeniable

The Villages surrender to despair and

hurl themselves from the cliff top onto

the rocks far below it was a strange

book and made all the stranger by the

fact that it appeared to be utterly

unique I could find no record of it in

any catalogue I had available and after

a few calls to a couple of museums and

archives I knew dealt with similar texts

I was convinced that this may well have

been a completely unique book this

didn't please me as much as you might

imagine because what it meant was that I

had an artifact on my hands

1.the belonged far more in a museum than

it did in a library I'd only had a

museum worthy book come once before and

the process of authentication and the

work involved in selling it had quite

frankly not been worth the amount that I

sold it for museums are not as

well-funded as private collectors beyond

that there was something about the book

itself that unsettled me reading it was

disorientating in a way that I can't

easily put into words

especially the woodcuts although they

were just the villian or the clips or

empty forests or mountains they were

quite crude in many ways but certainly

not unsettling and yet twice when

reading it and observing the wood cuts I

fell off my chair over the week I

possessed it I had enough dizzy spells

that I had to book an appointment with

my doctor although at the time I didn't

make any direct connection between them

and the book I had bad dreams as well

I don't recall them with any clarity but

I'm rather sure they were dreams of

falling Mike came in at the end of that

week I wouldn't go so far as to say I

was expecting him but I put a half dozen

books to one side for his consideration

as I assumed he'd be in at some point

soon as was his habit he said almost

nothing and the cold February air was

enough that he didn't even feel the need

to remove his scarf so only the faintest

hints of that branching scar could be

seen creeping out from below it

the bulbs crackled and brightened in his

presence and I presented the books I had

chosen to him he spent some minutes

looking through them before pushing them

back with a shake of the head this was

not unusual for him and I took it as no

insult

I turned to put them back on the shelf

when I was almost overcome by a wave of

dizziness I gripped the back of my chair

and steadied myself when I looked back

at Mike he was staring at the light in

the book with a wild expression I had

never seen on his face before he pointed

at XL t aura and asked me how much it

was I started to tell him it wasn't for

sale but he had this look in his eyes

this furious desperation it scared me to

be honest and I had a sudden sense that

this man was willing to kill me for that

book all this combined with the

discomfort I felt that the thing anyway

was just a bit too much for me I named a

figure that I thought was maybe double

what it was actually worth and Mike

wrote me how to check so fast that I

thought his pen would go clean through

the paper for this I insisted on ringing

him up a receipt and without another

word he was out into the rainy February

afternoon and that would have been it

given what happened next I don't think I

would ever have seen Michael crow again

if it wasn't for the simple fact that

his cheque bounced I didn't quite

believe it at first he'd always been so

willing to drop huge amounts of money on

books that the idea of him not being

able to afford something had never quite

registered but there was no mistake

after no small amount of consideration I

decided that the only decent thing to do

was to actually go to him and discuss

the matter maybe I could get the book

back maybe I could make alternate

arrangements either way I felt like I

owed it to Mike I had his address on

file from a delivery he had requested a

couple of months back so it was a simple

matter to close up the shop early and

make the short walk across check Chester

to his flat rather lavish by student

standards but easy enough to find the

sky was a bruised gray as I walked

across town and I was glad I had thought

to bring my umbrella as it was promising

to be a storm I recognized the smell

from Mike's previous visits though even

then I didn't

realize what it meant I reached his door

and knocked I was careful to be firm but

not aggressive in my knocking as I had

an odd conviction that an overly

confrontational knock would have made it

much harder to retrieve the book I

needn't have given it any thought at all

the door opened before I had even

finished knocking and I had the oddest

feeling in my stomach as though I was

standing on the edge of a great drop and

I took an instinctive step back Mike

stood there looking terrible from inside

caved in the odor of a man who has not

left the room or opened a window for

some days strewn across the floor were

pages and pages of sprawled Latin texts

which alarmed me until I saw the

unharmed and whole book clutched in his

arms I started to explain what had

happened and why I was there but he

didn't seem to be registering my words

just staring blankly at the space I

occupied as though he didn't notice I

was standing there I remember I just

about reached the point of repeating the

word check over and over in the hopes he

acknowledged it when the first droplets

of rain began to hit his window without

warning Mike's eyes went wide and what

might have been realization or maybe

just fear and his face got so pale his

branching scar seemed almost to vanish

in the first peal of thunder rolled over

us and that smell hit me with such an

intensity I could barely breathe I was

on the floor before I knew what was

happening and turned to see Mike running

full pelt down the corridor clutching

the lightener book I must have hit my

head and my thinking was very muddled I

was convinced he was trying to escape

with the book with a determination that

quite frankly I never would have

expected from myself I decided that I

had to stop it I had to stop Michael

crew from stealing my Leitner so I got

up umbrella forgotten and chased him out

into the pouring rain we weaved our way

through chitt Chester lightning arcing

through the sky in a way I'd only seen a

handful of times in the 40 years I lived

there I could just about make out the

fleeing figure of Mike in front of me

and sometimes when the Lightning lit the

sky

I could have sworn I saw someone else

chasing him it was hard to make out as

it only seemed to appear for those

momentary flashes but it seemed tall

thin its limbs angular and branching

like Mike's car I don't know how he got

into the bell tower that chester

cathedral it stands separate from the

main building tall imposing and square

starkly illuminated by the flashing sky

one of the doors at the base stood open

and i didn't stop to think how it had

been opened before dashing inside and

starting up the stairs the smell was so

thick inside i gagged on the acrid

stench in my determination to chase a

young man stealing a book i had

apparently completely forgotten my age

which returned all at once and I

collapsed slightly on the stairs I began

to climb then slowly towards the top of

the bell tower I have never been afraid

of heights but as I got higher and

higher up those stairs my head started

to swim and my heart was beating so fast

I was honestly worried that I was in

danger of a heart attack finally I

reached the top flight of stairs

I could hear shouting from the bell room

it was Mike he was screaming something

that sounded like a chant or a prayer

most of it was in languages I didn't

know but I could make out the words

LT aura vertigo and the vast I reached

the top and there I saw Mike standing

before an open window he held the book

before him like a protective ward and in

front of him was a strange

branching figure it crackled and fizzed

lit by a strobing white light as though

the lightning was within the room itself

it was just standing there like it

couldn't approach as Mike reached the

crescendo at his invocation with a cry

of I and yours he lept through the open

window

and presumably to his death the strange

figure cried out a sound like tearing

sandpaper and seemed to be dragged

through the window with him the sharp

smell vanished instantly and I was alone

in the dark

I say presumably about his jumping

almost a hundred feet to his death

because when I went out I could find no

body at the base of the tower neither

could the police who obviously treated

me like a lunatic when the sky cleared

shortly afterwards it became apparent

that all the windows to the bell chamber

were closed and sealed I never saw

Michael crew or the lightener book again

statement ends michael crew another name

that seems to crop up more than once in

relation to lightness and twice

regarding this particular volume the

events here seem to have taken place a

couple of years after those of statement

nine nine nine one zero zero six could

his exposure to the bone Turner's tale

have catalyzed an interest in Jurgen

Leitner or perhaps an early experiment

it seems as though he was attempting to

use the book as protection against

whatever was chasing him did the bone

Turner's tale not work in that regard

what was it that chased and bringing

that smell with it

it was ashamed that exile T aura was

burned in the end I would have been

fascinated to read it especially as

there is one feature that I'm surprised mr. Knox did not mention

comparing his statement to that of Dominic Swain in zero one three to eight zero six 

the book who mr. Knox received did not seem to have a woodcut of the dark night sky with the branching arching design of the Lichtenberg figure

Supplemental.

Someone else has been going down into the tunnels. When I came in yesterday, I noticed the trapdoor appeared to have been disturbed. It was unlocked. I confronted the others but they all denied

of course 

someone must think there is more down there of value

unless they're trying to hide something

searching while hiding it could be either 

I might try to set up a camera to watch the trapdoor if I can find somewhere effective to hide it. 

I did go down there to see if I could find anything, but it seems much as it did last time. The only difference now is all the spiderwebs. They seem to have spread down there. I think I saw some of the larger specimens actually eating the remains of the worms. It was a disconcerting sight, and I left almost immediately.
