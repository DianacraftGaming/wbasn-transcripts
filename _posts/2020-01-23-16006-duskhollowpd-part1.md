hello it's Johnny here Johnny from the

Magnus archives you remember we are

playing a role playing game as part of

our season break content so I have with

me here some other people so who do we

have I'm Frank and I own voice for Sarah

hello I am Lori and I produce the Magnus

archives I'm Alex i voice martin and

dude like other shows as well and I'm

Sasha I voiced Georgie fantastic so we

are going to be playing a game of dust

Hollow PD which is a setting from

MacGuffin & Company which is - ashes

games company just case you didn't know

go make games yeah we do is a system

neutral micro setting so we are going to

be playing it using the Cthulhu hack

which is a very simple rules light

investigation and cosmic horror system

by Paul Bauhaus key and yeah it's gonna

be some spooky probably a little bit

funny but mainly spooky times I'm sure

everything's gonna go fine it's just a

just a standard normal police procedural

run for a gentle time yeah no absolutely

the flames near the water cools out of

water is our big problem for the session

I mean that that would be a problem for

the holder I can't wait so interview

little old ladies so there's just little

old ladies and nothing wrong so the idea

behind dust collar PD is das Hollow is a

weird town the rain never stops the

crimes are all horrific and you guys

you're the police who have to

investigate all these definitely normal

crimes extremely it's the normal estas

Colo is somewhat of a city out of time

you might ask where it is to which I

would say probably yes yeah it's

probably Britain but you know Britain

where a lot of people have sort of noir

American accents the rain never stops

unless it's high summer when it's

perfect arson weather dry and hot that

does sound like Cardiff say it stops

raining that's not Wales

there's a reason it's so green okay

technology is fixed for each thing at

the perfect war level so all the phones

are rotary some of the bars still run on

gas light there is an internet

connection of the library

it's an old CRT monitor and it works the

dial-up connection works at one

revelation per case yep your car is a

1956 Ford police car and you all have

1920s detective special revolvers and at

the police station most people are still

going on typewriters or at least there's

the background sound of typewriters even

if everyone's actually filling in their

extensive case reports mostly by hands

so when I say zoom enhance someone just

holds the newspaper slightly closer yes

well no I mean who knows maybe forensics

has some really high tech like they

might have microscopes that have a

screen as they find that wait this

sample it just doesn't make sense unless

it's a perfectly normal crime so the

rules of the setting are as follows

first up player characters cannot laugh

you guys can laugh and your player

characters can occasionally make the you

know a grim quip here and there but they

cannot laugh they are not having a good

time all cases must have at least one

mundane lead followed before anything

even remotely supernatural can be

brought up by the characters with the

exception of well one of you there are

no ghosts lots of weirdness no ghosts

everyone and a scholar thinks ghosts are

ridiculous and finally everyone in the

dust collar Police Department is

overworked jaded and has no time to be

forming grand unified theories of

weirdness with one exception which we

will get to in a second so before we go

through a little bit of system

explanation let's go around the table

and just have a quick introduction to

everyone's characters I'm Frank again

I'm playing car hustle Beck who is the

sergeant he is a man doesn't have to be

but he could be

probably is let's say don't undermine my

choices man who places a lot of emphasis

on arrests and not enough emphasis on

you know paperwork or evidence or due

process yes one thing that I should

point out and we've had a conversation

about this beforehand is player

characters in dust colo are or were bad

cops good cops don't end up in dust colo

so we've had a conversation off air

about what aspects of bad or corrupt

policing we're comfortable portraying

you know a fun recording so that will be

feeding into the characters that we are

playing Laurie so I am playing Emma

vilensky she's got a squint she's a

conspiracy theorist doesn't trust anyone

and has ended up in dust kado because it

hasn't been proven but maybe she may

have in the interest of proving to the

rest of the world but she already knows

they do require evidence and I know but

the world doesn't know so much she may

have tampered with some evidence in the

past so obviously your character is the

exception to thee you can't make

connections and you can't leap

immediately to bizarre conclusions you

can do that as much as you want how do

you feel about Emma's belief in ghosts

Emma can probably believe in ghosts but

everyone thinks you're an idiot

I lost my cat I am playing Archie

Murdoch who is a rookie beat cop

that's Archie Murdoch of the dust collar

right yes yeah Archie Murdoch of the

dust kalo Murdoch's and Archie is a cop

insofar as technically graduated from

the actually thinking about it your

family might actually be from Morgan's

Hill which is the bright lovely

neighboring town just over the river to

dust coal okay it's a bit of a disgrace

that you've ended up with a with a beat

in dust collar but it's fine because

I'll she just makes a point of telling

everyone that it was it was a choice

because this is whether you know the

most works needed yeah like honestly

that the Morgans Hill Police Department

they do very little there's that there's

a lot of helping old ladies across the

streets you can only recapture the same

Swan so many times

absolutely they have a lot of like dress

uniform functions but I mean you've

never really seen a Morgan's Hill police

officer not in dress uniform well I

would say though is a lot of people

claim that to be you know a good cop

you've got to have you know skills

training experience what Archie has is

is a can-do attitude which is basically

the same thing right you believe you can

do then maybe you can do participant

still get a medal right and Sasha I am

playing Gabrielle Schreiber a

no-nonsense detective who takes an

attitude to police thing of like there

are definitely patterns to crimes and

they can always always be solved by just

looking for the simplest solution like

all murders are done by spouses and if

the neighbor says that they saw the

victims brother like turning up with an

axe knocking down the door and then

leaving covered in blood they probably

didn't it's always the spouse

circumstantial evidence it's always the

spouse you are playing I believe this

game I'm playing a skeptic yes okay

sweeping statements are the best

statements is generalizations exist for

a reason yes

so the Cthulhu hack is by way of various

indie games are very very loosely based

on the first edition D&D so what you

have is you have your six main stats

that are the same as the dragon so

strength dexterity constitutional wisdom

intelligence and charisma you have a

score in each of them from two to twenty

and these are for your saves you will be

rolling them whenever you are trying to

not come to some sort of harm that can

be physical harm you're rolling

dexterity to dodge a missile no one's

firing missiles at you in dust color

don't you worry or intelligence to solve

a puzzle before a ceiling collapses on

you or charisma to not be convinced that

your partner is secretly a shape-shifter

who you should probably just you know

take out protip the rest the party

notice he only said missiles weren't

going to happen so that means the other

two are a so when you need to make a

save you take a 20-sided dice

you roll it and if it is under your

score you have succeeded if it is equal

to or over you have failed I first heard

you're so strange and interesting to me

I don't think I like it's it's a very

it's a emphasis on hack because it was I

think his first addition went into the

black hack and then the black hack

became the Zulu that there's a whole

pedigree but if you're wrong with

advantage you roll to 20 sided dice to

the 20s and take the lowest if you're

rolling with disadvantage you roll to

and take the highest now alongside your

core stats you also have resources these

are things you use to advance the

stories find clues and do your

investigation so you have flashlights

which are to find clues by examining

areas reading books you know nerd stuff

then you have smokes that is what you

use to find clues by talking to people

social interaction you will also have a

list of supplies which are things that

you personally have that you can use to

solve problems move the investigation

forward etc each of these is a die type

from a d4 to a d12 and the way it works

is if you're using it you succeed you

you what you want to happen works you

then roll the dice and on a1 or a2

something bad happens as a consequence

of your success and your dice type goes

down one so if you were rolling a d8

it's now a d6 for the next time if you

roll a 1 or 2 on a d4 you are out of

that resource and something real bad

happens so your flashlights and your

smokes and your supplies are all things

their resources that you spend to

advance the investigation and you kind

of don't want to run out of them for

instance Frank you'll notice that hustle

Beck has a hip flask that has a dye top

of d4 that means if we were using your

hip flask to solve a problem that's a

high-risk move new new party goal we

have to make it so that this story must

advance by removing your sobriety

problem guys achieve a higher plane you

also all have some special abilities

which

we'll get into as and when they come up

and I have nicked a little bit from

trail of Cthulhu where everyone has

various expertise or skills that dictate

who gets what clues I've kind of

incorporated that into this so everyone

has a list of expertise is what that

means is given a lot of you are probably

going to be at the same crime scenes at

various points it dictates who gets what

clues if there's a clue about say

accounting who has accounting sergeant

has accounting as an expertise so if

you're going over some account books

you're the one who gets those clues gets

too confusing you can use your hip flask

d4 to make those numbers line right up

or at least double also your expertise

is can potentially serve as hints in

terms of if you anything a ways to

advance the investigation just have a

look your expertise errs and see what

options might be there lastly you have

damage dice which are how much damage

you do unarmed or armed if you somehow

get into a fight you have a stress dice

called a sanity dice in the Cthulhu hack

but I prefer to contextualise these

things as stress because within the

context of dust kalo it's much more very

intense periods of horrific things

occurring in short order which can let's

say lead to some extreme reactions

rather than you're gradually going also

mean indescribable Horrors don't tend to

come across great in an entirely audio

format where we have to describe all the

horrors also Alex that that's what we do

in our other podcast that's our

indescribable we just spend 160 episodes

to describe so when you have a

particularly stressful experience I will

ask you to roll the stress dice a

similar to any other resource if it's a

1 or 2 it degrades one step and you will

have a bad reaction to what's going on

if you roll one or two when it does a d4

you have a bit of a breakdown you will

be removed from the case and will spend

the rest of the investigation having

chat with Doc's lauter the police

psychiatrist who's lovely sorry I'm

immediately I hear the surname Slaton I

immediately go to Rimes and like doc

slaughter ships daughter she's the the

psychiatrist for dust collar PD and

she's she's very good I think you're

thinking of a phone sturgeon ship

surgeon and Oh finally you have your hit

points if your hit points are gone you

might die and when you lose all your hit

points a sight if you lose all your hit

points I will roll a dice to see what

horrible thing we are fine hey okay so

it's a rainy day in dust Hollow

well a rainy evening the day's go fast

and night is starting to fall the

streetlights outsider coming on one by

one

people are walk-in the streets umbrellas

up coats on heads down

you can almost hear mournful jazz it's

just the wind a bitter wind bitter

syncopated wing a call comes in as a new

body

Geoffrey Mariner heir to the Mariner

fortune has been found dead and

mutilated in his uptown apartment case

comes to you guys I've already forgotten

everything you told us except named

Geoffrey Mariner and he's rich the

Mariner fortune

they made their fortune in boats

shipping it's a shipping fortune and he

was dead in his apartment he's been

found dead and mutilated why least

according to the reports the reports

come in from the housekeeper a woman

named Nellie your car pulls up in Uptown

the townhouses of Uptown are tall

they're narrow tall very well-built lots

of arches the door to this one is open

and there is another police car already

there with some be cops just you know

putting down markers and going about the

business of establishing this is a

horrible crime scene horrible do we

recognize them yeah they're also from

the police department

their names are Greg yeah big Greg and

bigger Greg they're both very tall I

don't trust them no you shouldn't

that's like all they definitely one of

them definitely stole your yogurt from

the fridge what did they use it for they

ate it you can't see I'm doing air

quotes I could share in your voice it

wasn't looking at you so the car door

opens and you step outside I'm gonna

just charge in doors open yep I don't

need to check with anybody I'm just

gonna walk straight in the housekeeper a

middle-aged woman in exactly what you

would imagine an uptown housekeeper to

be wearing is standing off to the side

of a long corridor and the activity

seems to be mainly around a study just

off the corridor to the left okay I'm

gonna follow

I'm checking for scorch marks on the way

there aren't any scorch marks that you

can see in fact there doesn't seem to be

any evidence of violence or disturbance

in the main hallway at all suspicious oh

geez I'm gonna go hang out with big Greg

and bigger Greg yes as a beat cop I you

know have to check in with the beat cops

yeah so with the thing in the mutilation

yeah nasty all right adopts a sort of

foe kind of pie pose what are we looking

at for boys he's dead in there right put

the tape up good work boys and then

Archie Skinner kind of migrated slowly

into the building cuz no one seems to be

minding no one no one stops you then my

grades

Archie does I will also approach the

brakes now that this embarrassment has

gone inside me that's me dead body yes

in there any idea how long ago he died

oh not a detective

any hunch while ago or now between a

while ago and now all right thanks

correct no ice thanks such a go so the

study is messy it's cluttered this

papers all over the desk a few not to

the floor bookshelves annoying the walls

and those walls that are not lined with

bookshelves have framed often they look

like official pieces of timetabling and

one or two our announcement posters for

various pieces of industrial

transportation quite a lot of you know

how they always used to have

announcement posters for like new trains

or new like train lines and services

wait are you i p 90 from chicago in only

three minutes yeah absolutely

there's quite a lot of those around a

few fir for boats and like new plane

roots looks like this guy was going to

infrastructure at least he was until

somebody murdered him because his corpse

is currently sprawled out in the middle

of the study likes infrastructure

dislikes evisceration that is a very

good point you

good role flash yes you've acquired a

clue so Romney flashlights okay I am

returned remember how so I have to use

my d8 see yes and then I have to roll

you just like you have already found the

clue okay so you're rolling to see if

there's any negative consequence of you

finding the clue to okay

there is so what was your die type d8 it

is now a d6 and you are so busy looking

at the posters on the wall you straight

up trip over the corpse jeez no fun

thing finally found the guy with the

lady's hands like kind of grips around

you your ankle and the dead eyes stare

up at you you it takes so long to

actually say that you should probably

make a stress role as well following

often that the rest of you don't have to

make a stress well you've seen a lot of

dead bodies and we're two dead bodies

than this end up seen such an

incompetent rookie before there

yeah just like mad doggin you from

across the room not if you need to make

a stress roll because Johnny likes all

of you let's see a three that is enough

but you're you're you're keeping it

together oh it's good my doormats gonna

smell of it can you stop stepping in the

court I'm trying he's everything

oh god okay one sec I just kind of keep

backing away until I hit wall and then

sidle maybe brushing a few things at the

wall yep till I eventually escape the

puddle that is this person yeah I'm just

staring at you the whole time and I put

their arm around you and it says duck

don't worry about the corpse the

important thing these time tables then

perfect I hate codes in it's very

important you don't touch them step in

the corpse don't move the time tables

right a lot of the quality of the papers

on the desk are also various sort of

clearly research into similar things

there are there are time tables on the

desk as well if you want to have a look

absolutely okay please follow me

flashlights so I'm brewing 8 what is

your flashlight so you see your

bandolier of flashlights remains well

stop

Oh - okay no that's that's for what are

your expertise is by the way

cryptography occult photography flattery

document analysis analysis do at the

restaurant fiend document analysis these

are definitely the clues you're picking

up on so yeah there's it looks like he

was writing a book on trains

specifically at the different train

types that were issued by British Rail

over the 20th century there are a lot of

you know old doctrines there's one that

seems to have been burned though it was

definitely a timetable you can tell by

the corner that remains unburned but

yeah it's in the sort of the metal waste

paper basket a lot of ashes and the

corner of what looks like a time table

it also looks like he was corresponding

with someone about it by the name of

Angelo Brock all great surname nice and

the last letter from her reads dear

Geoffrey finally managed to find this

hope it lives up to everything where you

were expecting good luck Angela so

you've been looking at the timetables

the the documents who's looking at the

body I am okay I'm trying to see if I

can get a vague idea of like time of

death if it was mutilated before or

after he died okay so it looks like if

you would guess sometime within the last

24 hours

but the body is called so definitely

recently but not immediately the

mutilation you'd guess happened

afterwards given the lack of blood

around in fact there's very little blood

around the body and so has probably

moved here specifically given the amount

of chaos around it certainly looks more

like there was definitely some sort of

physical activity who may be a struggle

may be a dance you know but some people

were moving around here a lot in eg

before he died

pacifically he's had his chest just

carved open and you're not a you're not

an anatomist though you do have

forensics I believe yes the heart is

missing how long you got the call about

two hours ago okay yeah it looks like

you would guess after he died

someone came in here and just carved out

his heart can I get a flashlights role

from you can I just check because I

rolled a two and my flashlight does that

mean I'm knowing this oh goodness yes I

forgot that you'd you failed you're now

on a you know on a six and yeah I'm

gonna say is a negative consequence you

are absolutely it's like the timetables

are the key to everything

timetables are a hundred percent the key

to everything I had already anticipated

that got a one so you're now you're

already on a d4 for flashlights yeah

this is this is gonna this is gonna go

hmm brilliantly you are now covered in

blood you could go home and change but

you're not gonna have time like this is

this you've got to work this case you

know this is this is it's just coffee

through to the arrest at this point so

you're spending the rest of the

adventure

just a bit covered in blood final drive

eventually and yeah I would like to go

and interview the housekeeper all right

yes

hello officer hello it's detective yeah

sorry for your loss and all that it's I

mean it's a real tragedy our I didn't

yeah

Oh lost the old business isn't it yes it

certainly is so one was a victim married

no no I'm really okay Jeffery he didn't

really go outside much didn't didn't

talk to a lot of people yeah yeah it is

he had his pen pals but you know mostly

he was he was just doing his doing his

research his mom and dad there they're

not in the country a lot you understand

always traveling for business very much

as leave him to his own devices okay

yeah yeah yeah we're from oh I don't

know he didn't really didn't really talk

to me about it a lot there was just a

lot of a lot of letters came from the

occasional package and then he sent out

a lot back you know just it was nice to

see him to see him have friends I just

so you know I'm drifting over to listen

to this and I don't when just subtly try

and just throw some salt on her skin

because that's how you tell if someone's

an alien oh it sorry yeah

sir I seem to have some sort on me how

do you apologize

detectives I love the room is

immediately garnished just like was he

married no oh so you did it then I'm

learning a lot and you say you'd found

the body did you I did

so about about maybe midday a lot

crashing from the room but that's not

that's not always that unusual and

generally for a fight if I you know if I

if I check up Jeffery gets a little bit

and got got a little bit I right so I

left it for a while but he didn't come

out when it was in a time so I checked

and I found well I found him like this

but there was the the window was open

and I ran to it and I saw someone

climbing over the the back fence to get

away did you know yes

and can you describe this person well

they had I mean that they were kind of

bloody but they they had short blonde

hair and I think it was I think it was a

woman she was tall and thin and had a

scar on her face and now can you tell me

what you were doing for the day before

you found it cleaning cooking arranging

the beds I read a book for it for an

hour or two I like to take my breaks

around 2 o'clock and I'm I tend to read

Archy pipes up at that point and what

was the what was the publication on that

on that book or what was the publication

date hmm

I mean I mean it was it's Joseph Conrad

so like I imagine some time in the she

will sort of pass you a book oh you have

it with you do you

mmm very convenient Artie again like

looking just for the approval yeah what

dead convenient mmm do you always carry

your books around with you at all times

when you being interviewed by the police

I mean it was I mean I wasn't caring it

was on the table just there you saw

saying this is your book then recite the

Iban number for me please and no please

roll

smokes yes okay three that's enough

that's that's fine so while this

interview is going on is anyone doing

any more analysis of the scene anymore

okay well something genuine now is yes

as much some riffing around them like

now give it give it back like yeah kind

of trying to pull off suspicious but not

really I am actually gonna attempt some

legitimate investigation and go over to

the window to see if the route that the

escaping killer took is something that

can be like also examined that kind of

shot many flashbacks wrong to you know a

few things going over to the window

firstly that the back fence is clearly

visible from this window if someone was

climbing out over the fence you could

see it from here secondly there is an

ashtray next to the window with various

cigarette butts in most of which are

camels but there is one which is a mole

bra brand and there is a matchbook for

the last draw I love a good

what's the match book of matches as in

like is it is it from like the pink

post-its from the last drop

oh it's literally from the last drop you

probably wouldn't go there it's kind of

a rough establishment but it is a bar in

the downtown area famous for just like

there's a back alley where there are

lots of bodies there mostly from the pub

but sometimes people will just you know

leave one there for a laugh hilarious

I'd love to leave a corpse for a joke

[Laughter]

your your your rights you did throw your

flashlights as well so you fall out the

window

nice could you roll me a d4 and take

that much damage how much damage oh okay

cool what is your health by the way see

if I tell you that you'll try and avoid

killing me I'm sure thirteen hit points

to nine okay noted you guys said it's

like less than if you're you're on the

ground floor

he just lands really awkward in a bush

I'm gonna use that distraction as a time

to pocket a timetable or two I'm gonna

need more than one cuz I'm gonna

cross-reference absolutely you need them

for the wall the corkboard yes

absolutely I'm gonna be looking for

codes later I also want to plant some

goo homemade goo that I carry around

with me in a key place maybe if I've

noticed the ashtray in the ashtray just

because sometimes people need a little

bit of help to understand and the aliens

around us so you just drop in some goo

in the ashtray

I'm dropping some goo in the ashtray

y'all do made of it's like a slime

recipe so you've got what is it flap

dexterity roll to see anyone else

sinuses rolling my d20 and why are you

trying to get under your dexterity I

have a dexterity of eight you know it's

possible nope nope

fifteen so you guys you sort of pop up

and just get a face full of good yeah

take another point of Daniel what are

you doing kids so the sergeant is

covered in blood

the rookies covered in goo is there any

more investigation you'll want to do for

this I'd like to have a look to see if I

can find like a diary or an address book

because okay sure Geoffrey Mariner

wasn't married but he probably had like

a cheating partner okay his girlfriend

was married maybe his girlfriend was

married or his boyfriend or his

boyfriend their role some flashlights

just turn on my torch got five okay he

does have an address book it's a little

bit blood-stained because it was in the

inside pocket of his jacket along with a

pack of Camel cigarettes opening it

there are actually a lot of addresses

for someone who didn't leave the house a

lot he had a lot of he had a lot of

addresses in his book no real detail

about any of them but there is one page

that is clearly more thumbed and

referenced than any other which is

Angela Krakow and an address in das

hollow out in the suburbs

are there any photographs around the

room some photographs restrains is one

of a good-looking lorry the reason I

asked us cuz I have expertise

photography and I was wondering if I

could gain any extra clues from no you

can't no jeez well I mean this this is

this is an unsolvable case what are we

thinking I'm gonna look around

spontaneous hard combustion I just want

to see if there's like any just like

bloody handprints or anything that looks

like it's been moved around or taken

also you know what even without a

flashlight rolled say that it looks like

a lot of the furniture was moved away

from the center of the room there are a

few divots you're like oh the shows long

should be here but it's been pushed up

against the wall so it does look like

someone's cleared a space around there's

a knock at the door and the two Greg's

are there Sarge coroner's here wants to

take the body

if you don't mind I'd I'd like one last

check on the body before they take it

I'm gonna just spray some go no I was I

to go for the self to see if he

dissolves no he does not dissolve that

okay good to know good to know good to

know good to know

can we take a photo of the body with one

of those like big flash I mean I think

oh absolutely

Emma gets out her camera mm-hmm

and takes a nice okay I have a weird

obsession with and it's a really

specific period of time but no deal of

it the period of time where you still

have this off you know like the canvas

expanding ones but they were pocketable

but it was like it was like this case

and you would open it and expand it so

it's like a pocket camera that still

goes about as big as your act yeah

that's that's what it is there shouldn't

be not with this design of camera but

there's still a little bit absolutely

yeah I take a very lovely photo you can

get that developed in a darkroom later

so the ambulances pulled up a couple of

EMTs are wheeling in a gurney along with

doctor smoking with the coroner for the

police department he's very tall very

thin slicked back hair and always a big

smile we all know we all done okay yeah

hmm yes hello fascinating corpse are we

all done here I can take it away to do

my autopsy see what sir see what's

inside this inside what's not inside

sergeant you intrigue me

as hot as missing Oh fascinating

wonderful obviously not for him but for

me hmm

lovely news yeah so maybe you keep an

eye out see if anything else is missing

salutely or how well it was yes well

that is always the question is if people

are so keen to cut up people's bodies

but they're often so the habit it or if

it was just one hell of a heart attack

me a heart attack so powerful that it

exploded and disappeared not possible

that's my job to find out and I'm eager

to do so so if you'll excuse me I'm

going to go and start

cutting him up oh what a good day speak

to you later

nice guy of character easy though easy

in character yeah I don't trust him so

is there anything else anyone wants to

do with this crime scene I want to have

a look at the UM path awesome answer so

is that to get out the window from the

body role for that it's like this room

is walked through enough that it's hard

to tell there are some scratches on the

windowsill but whether that is somebody

climbing out or just the fact that it

seems relatively common use with Jeffrey

smoking out of it who can say again the

back garden there are some squashed

plants but whether that is somebody

fleeing to the fence or someone doing

some gardening hard to tell and again

there's actually no I will have one

flashlight no anybody got a d4 you've

any go d4 and it's too early to

completely burn you out do I do and

don't investigate anymore stand but the

the fence it's a little bit askew could

have just been could've just been poorly

made it could have been someone vaulting

over any marks on it not obviously not

okay I mean okay do you want to make a

flashlights role do it I don't know what

the ramifications for you losing it all

but doing I can't see it what is that

that's a one that's a one you're not

dead bludgeoned to death by your own

flash do find a bloody handprint

it's faint like clearly the blood wasn't

super fresh but yet somebody gripped the

top of this with a hand that was bloody

and that's the fence that's the thing

Wow okay metagame for some reason I'm

assuming we're pre DNA but you can do a

blood type match that's a thing you've

mistaken me for someone who ever cares

you know what that's good point that's a

good point I apologize

so Nellie obviously doesn't have anybody

to verify her alibi of I'm cleaning all

day so I won't be going through the

whole house just checking up on how

clean it actually

is looking for dust real clean mmm

cocaine like what's a food situation is

the fridge there is big post you that

hasn't really been touched I'd better

test that does it taste good

Romney flashlights real good reason to

lose a flashlight 10 oh good tastes real

good I mean some tasty stew or tasty

poison think I search on it by solving

the mystery too early real sorry Frank

just to be there you're now out of

flashlights I know what's gonna happen

because of that

but for now you're not able to look

around fiducia can still talk to people

for clues we can't look until something

happens that refreshes your flashlights

you got tired tired eyes in the garden a

mess so I'm probably gonna call the

initial crime scene there and probably

the first episode I think we were wildly

successful so it does make sense you've

got a lot of clues you do have a lot of

clues you should be able to solve it

like that I think this is a no case I

think we all know what's going on here

poisonous to boys and exploding hearts

to aliens yeah we will be back in two

weeks with the next installment of dust
