statement begins 



------



life is hard 

I don't a bum your hat or anything but yeah 

you're all alone trying to connect with people

trying to find your place in the world

but in the end the only person you really know is yourself 

and even then not all that well 

it's plenty of things I've done I couldn't explain to you

I mean I'm constantly constantly looking back at my past self and thinking one idiot 

how the hell could he have done such an obviously stupid thing 

how was I surprised it went so badly 

what a relief I'm now so much older and wiser 

except that last part never really turns out to be true does it 

the line of when you were your dumb younger self seems to keep moving forward with you until each more mature and reasonable version of you eventually falls foul of it  and becomes a young idiot 

and when you add in another person you reach a whole other level 

you can love them marry them dedicate your life to them 

that's not the same as actually understanding them

I was with Alberto for 15 years and I tell you what I could always anticipate him 

he always used to get annoyed at how predictable I found his mood sometimes

but damned if I ever really knew why 

of course it doesn't help that when you're that close to someone everything starts to reflect on each other 

one bad mood feeds into another and stress just bounces back and forth between you 

you can get real bad if you're not careful

and we weren't careful 

the thing is when

we both found ourselves in positions to be working from home we actually thought it was going to be really good for our relationship 

the two of us spending all our time together 

we reckoned it was going to be real romantic 

we were real stupid back then and when Alberto's parents offer to sell us their second home in Cheadle

we thought it was a great investment

nice and quiet

good neighborhood 

just a real nice home for the two of us and so much bigger than anything we could afford in the city 

and before you think Cheadle the suburb of Manchester that's not the one I'm talking about 

I'm talking about Cheadle the suburb of stoke-on-trent

he'll technically is not even a suburb it's just a village that looks so much like a suburb that you could pull it up and drop it on the edge of any dull town in England and it would look the same

just Street after Street of identical blandly Pleasant houses 

all winding around each other in dead ends and cul-de-sacs and one-way systems 

making sure every house has plenty of inoffensive garden 

I've never seen people happily living in a place so obviously dead 

two years we lived there

two years imprisoned in that beige comfortable house with the man I loved watching our relationship turn to sniping and snapping and bitter passive aggression 

I'd say that cheating on him was a foolish act of past me but honestly it's one of the few decisions I've ever made that I completely understand 

I didn't even try to hide it not really 

when he found out and it all ended I kind of hated myself for just how relieved I was that I'd finally be able to leave that place 

to get in my car and drive away from that gentle suburban nightmare

I mean I'd lived there for two years and I still got lost trying to leave 

I thought that was the worst that place would ever make me feel 

wish I'd been right

I got a cheap apartment in Liverpool and tried to tell myself I was happier 

the single life Footloose and sitting at home binging bad TV 

I tried to get back into the club scene but honestly I think I'm just too old now 

the music was too loud the drinks were too expensive and the sort of thing I used to take to be dancing all night now hit me with a down so hard that I had to write off almost the entire week 

he didn't help that over the course of a 10-year relationship my friends had become our friends and there weren't any of them siding with me in this situation

some would drop platitudes about maybe reconnecting after the fallout was done with 

but I know when I'm being handled by people who don't want to create any more drama 

it was miserable but every time I thought about going back I felt nauseous the idea of returning to those eggshell walls that we never got around to repainting 

and the living room that expected me to sit there and watch Midsomer Murders until I passed away peacefully in my sleep 

it made me want to throw up 

I'd probably have stayed away forever if it hadn't been for the moose 

there was a carved wooden moose you see 

something Alberto's grandfather had carved

apparently and a real family heirloom 

it was an ugly old thing with this weird angular face that always made my skin crawl a bit 

I'd never let him display it in our house so it had lived in one of the suitcases under the stairs 

the suitcases I pulled out and filled in a tearful rage when I was leaving 

so yeah

I'd kind of accidentally stolen the moose 

when he finally realized and texted me demanding it back I should probably just have sent it by post 

but no 

for some reason I decided I was going to drive all the way down there and give it back in person 

maybe I was hoping for a fight or just to see him again 

I don't know 

I was younger then 

foolish

it was late when I got to what I thought was his street 

driving through the one-way signs and well-maintained gardens that bordered that snaking road

the Sun had disappeared with the sky was still fairly light 

that late summer Twilight that seems to just drag on forever 

there weren't any other cars on the road and I was already getting frustrated 

my sat-nav had decided to start sending me around in a circle and I was apparently no closer to finding our Alberto's house 

the road one like I remembered them 

or rather they were exactly like I remembered them 

bland interchangeable with impossible to navigate 

I must have driven around for almost a half hour before I finally decided that if the internet and GPS couldn't help me 

I'd have a proper look at the actual paper map that I kept in the boot 

I spent a few minutes scanning the Cheadle area until I found the road I was looking for

ash Tree Hill 

then I drove on it 

I found a street sign at the next turning 

hoping to compare it to what was on the map 

and then I stopped because the sign said Road 

no name 

just Road 

it wasn't as though the actual name of the street had been defaced or removed 

the sign was complete 

it just didn't say anything else 

so I drove on until I found the next one 

Street 

I tried to compare it to the map 

maybe this place just had some really bland road names and somehow I'd never noticed in the two years I'd lived there 

but no the places on the map will have the names I remembered 

Chapel Street Meadow Drive Station Road Blanche

sure generic but not literally placeholder 

I pressed on looking for more 

Avenue c

lose

way 

lane 

only over the suffix never with a name attached 

by this point I was starting to feel a little bit freaked out and I decided to just get out of there 

I could come back later when my sat-nav was working properly 

in proper daylight 

the sky was getting darker by this point and I had to put my headlights on 

I still haven't seen any other cars on the road 

or as I thought more about it people on the streets 

but as you might imagine getting out of there proved even more difficult than finding the house I was looking for

every time I thought I'd found a main road that led out of this weird looping suburbia 

a one-way sign seemed to spring up directing me back into the sprawl 

I did U-turn after U-turn as I was channeled into one dead-end cul-de-sac after another 

until eventually I decided to simply disregard the one-way signs completely 

I cruised past the one that seems to be blocking my most likely exit and almost breathed a sigh of relief as I found myself leaving the suburban maze I'd been trapped in 

until it led me to an entirely different maze of unremarkable residential neighborhoods

even then I still didn't accept that I was trapped 

it didn't make any sense 

and it wasn't like I'd seen anything blatantly supernatural 

it wasn't that there was anything abnormal about the whole situation 

it was just that the normal seemed to go on forever 

at some point I got out of the car and start to hammering on random doors 

I mean I tried the doorbells at first but they were silent 

so I started knocking and knocking until my hand hurt 

there was no answer at any of them 

there were no lights on behind the drawn curtains and all the house numbers was zero 

I got back into my car started driving again 

going on and on until finally I ran out of petrol 

it rolled to a sputtering stop at the end of one of the indistinguishable dead ends 

it had been full dark for hours by this point and my dashboard claimed it was 3:00 a.m. 

my phone had died about an hour ago and once the last the power went in the car I was left with no way to tell the time at all 

I wished I hadn't thrown away the wristwatch Alberto had given me but it was too late for those regrets 

I stepped outside looking down the street 

there were no lights on in any of her houses but the identical lampposts bathed the place a sickly orange as far as I could see 

I decided that the roads must be the problem they were what was keeping me trapped in this place 

constantly turning and bending and confusing me 

if I just picked a direction and kept to it eventually I had to get to the edge of what by now I had decided was a newly built neighborhood that apparently no one had moved into yet 

as an explanation it didn't make any sense but it didn't need to 

not at that moment 

so I started walking 

going around houses and through gardens 

trying at all times to keep my direction straight and consistent 

I may be too old for clubbing but I still keep pretty active so getting over the fences wasn't much of a problem for me 

as I passed for my identical road to identical garden over and over again 

I don't know how long I went on like this but it felt like hours

at the start I was counting how many houses I passed but when I got to a hundred I stopped 

it was beginning to eat away and my careful rationalizations and I couldn't tell how that 

eventually my legs started to go and I decided I needed some rest

I was about to sit on the street when a thought occurred 

I marched up to a nearby front door prepared to kick in the flimsy looking wood but trying the handle revealed it was unlocked 

I don't know why I picked that house 

it was exactly identical to all the others 

I've often wondered if there was anything that drew me to it 

perhaps I was just unlucky 

or perhaps there only ever was one house 

the lights worked which was a relief 

and the inside looked exactly how I expected it to 

and I mean exactly how I expected it to 

from the blank IKEA furniture to the subtly patterned cream wallpaper to the picture frames lining the wall 

containing what were clearly stock photos 

each of a different family pantomiming a scene of domestic bliss 

I headed into the living room and sat down on one of the almost comfortable armchairs 

my body was aching and my eyes were heavy 

and I had the thought that maybe I should head up to the bedroom 

in the back of my mind though I knew that was a trap 

I had somehow become convinced that if I went to sleep here and I would never leave 

my hand drifted down and brushed the plastic remote control 

almost on instinct I picked it up and turned the TV on 

a cooking show 

a woman I almost recognized fussing over a turkey 

she was talking 

or at least it sounded like she was

for cadence and the sounds were so much like English that it took me almost a full minute to realize that she wasn't actually saying words 

she never looked at the camera 

there seemed to be something wrong with her eyes 

though I couldn't say what 

her hands moved over the pale skin of the turkey poking it and prodding it as though preparing it

though she wasn't actually doing anything to it 

eventually she gripped a part of it between finger and thumb and tore off a long strip of dry looking meat 

before tossing it over her shoulder and returning to her strange mimicry of cooking 

I hid the remote again 

a shopping channel 

the host was a tall clean-shaven man with close cropped hair

he was holding a brick and talking about it in that same flow of non words that still had a familiar salesman's patter

the screen scrolled the message by 

now

that there was neither price nor compact details as this man who wouldn't look at the camera earnestly pretended to sell me a brick

it was almost hypnotic 

I leaned back in the chair trying to think clearly about what was happening 

my eyes found themselves focusing on the ceiling 

on a small spot of red that seemed to have seeped through from above 

as I climbed those stairs I desperately tried to tell myself I didn't know what was going to be up there 

and to be fair I was surprised by some of the details 

but as soon as I saw the spot I just knew that someone else was up there and that they were dead 

the only questions were how and who 

I think I'd given up on why 

I didn't know them as it turned out 

a young woman conservatively dressed 

her face was bloody but I was sure I didn't recognize her 

she had a bag with her in our ID read your tonday Earthman 

not a name I'd ever encountered before 

just another victim of this place

it looked as though she had forced her head through the mirror on the dressing-table 

the shards cutting her face and neck to ribbons

a particularly large piece piercing her jugular spilling blood all down the unremarkable white table and onto the light brown carpet below 

I don't think she'd been dead that long I'm not a doctor and I didn't really try to check

instead I turned and ran 

all my tiredness gone in a sudden rush of adrenaline 

down the stairs out the door and into the night 

in the rows upon rows of bland empty houses and then all at once I wasn't running anymore 

I was lying on the ground collapsed the tarmac rough and cool against my cheek wet from my tears 

I was going to die

I knew that now 

just as she had just as anyone else who came here had 

how many corpses they waiting behind the placid facade of this endless fall suburbia

and that was what I heard it 

it was quiet my mind took a few moments to accept it could be real but sure enough there it was the sound of my phone's ringtone

I looked up it's not three doors down was my car the door still open where I had left it 

I stumbled over my legs still weak and grabbed the handset which should have been long out of battery and I stared at the glowing screen

it was Alberto 

he was calling me 

I don't know how but the tears came even faster now as I answered sobbing with relief to hear him yelling at me for taking so long that I forgotten was I even planning to bother 

I tried to reply to explain but all I could manage to say to get through the shaking sobs was 

I love you 

he went very quiet and then he hung up

it didn't matter though because when I looked around 

the windows of the houses were lit and a woman was coming down from her front door to ask if I needed help with my car 

we're working on it

the two of us 

we're not exactly back together yet 

but I think it's going well

he's reluctant to sell the house but I've made it quite clear that I'm never going back to the suburbs 

even if I can't really tell him why 

I checked to see if I could find anything about your Tunde health Miller and I did find a few old social media profiles 

but I wasn't able to get through to any family or friends 

as far as I can tell she disappeared a year ago and nobody noticed

statement ends 


the lonely is possibly the most insidious of the powers I believe 

certainly it is the one that most delights and having you do its work for it

even the spiders seem to have a hard time matching it for sheer seductiveness

time to yourself 

self-care 

putting yourself forward 

not being a burden on those you care about it 

doesn't even need to tell you any lies 

just waits for the lies you tell yourself 

we're all well aware that with Peter Lucas in charge of the Institute it's a very real danger to all of us 

we are trying 

Daisy Basira and I we don't leave the Institute much anymore 

so we do spend a lot of time together 

it's not that easy though when everyone has so many walls so many defenses 

sometimes you can feel lonely even when you're in the same room 

but it's better than the alternative and at least none of us are suffering alone

Martin's got it the worst of course but it still seems to be his choice and I have to trust that he knows what he's doing

still feeling weak restless 

I want to be proactive but the hassle that hasn't been going quite so well for us lately

come in Melanie 

John have you got a moment of course I was just having a statement and 

an old one yes an old one

I'm not 

I'm doing my best

sure 

what do you want 

I just wanted to talk to you about well my career I guess

my position in the archives 

I see 

look

I'm not going to do my job anymore

I am Not sure I follow you 

no 

we can't quit 

we've all tried 

I didn't say I was going to quit I said I'm not going to do my job

no researching no filing no field trips nothing that is going to help the Institute in any way

I'll still be around I just I can't be a part of this anymore 

if I get sick I get sick and and if I die 

why 

because this place is evil John and so doing this job

helping it out even in small ways 

is in some way evil too 

every time we try to use it to do good it just seems to make everything worse 

and and I will not be a part of that anymore

what about the unknowing 

we saved the world 

did we 

I mean I think it was the right thing to do but how many people were killed to do it 

we weren't even a neutral party 

we did it as agents of the eye 

because Elias told us to 

and then you put him in jail 

Martin put him there

and he's still doing harm 

you ever think that maybe this whole ritual business is just an excuse 

and that we're all part of some huge miserable fear machine 

I've considered the possibility 

right well 

if I'm just another cog maybe I can't leave the machine but from this moment I'm not turning 

I'm jammed 

did your therapist suggest this 

not not exactly

she's just helped me work through some things I've been thinking for a while

she doesn't know the details 

just that I'm in a bad contract situation working somewhere pretty awful 

she thinks I work for the Tories 

Melanie could you could you describe your therapist for me 

what you think I wouldn't notice if she had cobwebs down her face 

No

that's it isn't it 

do you really think I'm so stupid I wouldn't have noticed if my therapist was some kind of monster 

I just 

it was a worry 

right okay I know

that is why I ruined my first four sessions and almost torpedoed the chance at a genuinely really good therapist

because I was so paranoid that she was going to turn out to be some thing trying to manipulate me 

but no she's not full of spiders or made of wax or wearing the therapist skin or whatever

she's just a well-trained professional who I am paying to help me 

okay it's just the web can be subtle you understand 

and for all you know its plan is to paralyze you with indecision leaving you sitting here terrified that everything you do is somehow all part of its grand plan 

and who do you think that fear is gonna feed 

as well 

you are not the first to make that point 

look I didn't come here for a fight 

I just wanted to let you know what was going on

if you need me I'll be trying to get Daisy drunk 

good luck

I've only ever happened once 

in 2006 

she drank it 

sorry 

didn't mean to 

sure 

see you around
