case nine five five

Oh 307 Wallace Turner incident occurred

at the North Point prisoner of war camp

then later the sunken ship nemesis in

late 1942 statement taken 3rd of July

1955 at the Pyongyang Research Center

Beijing committed to tape 9th of October

2014

Gertrude Robinson recording I always

knew what sort of a thing war was even

when everything was going to hell even

when it just plain stopped making sense

and what I was seeing and hearing was

obviously ghosts and monsters even then

it still didn't surprise me not really I

never wanted to join up never cared

about fighting for my country I mean

what like my country ever fought for me

no no government ever gave a damn about

me and I didn't feel like I had anything

needed paying back on that front add to

that I was terrified

I'll miss it the thought of marching off

to war set my whole body shaking and I

can still remember the nightmares I had

when I got the notice I was half an inch

from going country going to prison and

taking my lumps but in the end it was my

dad that pushed me into the uniform and

it wasn't an argument or telling off

that did it either he just looked so

damn proud when I told him his son the

soldier don't over I'd ever seen him

look at me like that before and I just

didn't have the heart to break it me

going country would kill him so I had to

learn to kill others and that's the

thing that really scared me you know I

wasn't scared of dying not really

everything dies in the end

and the chaplain says you end up with

God Who am I to say different even if

it's just sleep just a quiet nothing

forever

it's not like you know enough to be

bored is it no death ain't scary but

killing that's scary

so look another living thing in the eyes

and end it forever strip away everything

they could have been could have done or

felt nobody should ever have to do that

sergeant once told me it's no different

from killing a chicken back home that

people aren't chickens and the idea that

war strips us all down to just a body

that moves and kills or falls and dies

makes me feel sick to my stomach I don't

like killing chickens either but none of

my feelings mattered in the end I got

the uniform the training and the gun

then ended up shipped off to the Pacific

to fight the Japanese I've got no desire

to share the details of my service

they're not memories I care to dwell on

and they're certainly not why I'm here

let's just say that neither my noble

comrades in arms nor the soldiers

fighting for His Majesty the Emperor

seemed to share my lofty ideals about

the sanctity of life still I got through

a while without dying and even without

killing anybody that I know of at least

if I had my gun plenty I guess and you

don't usually see where the bullet lands

and do you I was captured after about

six months and sent to the North Point

prison camp in occupied Hong Kong and at

the time it seemed like a relief but

then I hadn't heard the stories about

how the Japanese treated their POWs I

mean these days after the Tokyo trial

and everything I I guess everyone knows

how bad it was

but I didn't have a clue when we first

surrendered the things people will do to

their fellow man just because someone

with a shiny a badge tells them to and

even

then how treatment was a picnic compared

to the Chinese prisoners who came

through North Point but again that's not

the point

and I have no interest in dwelling on

the suffering plenty of others to tell

those stories if you want them I was in

that place for four months four months

of hell and I know others who are in

there a lot longer and I sure don't envy

them though the way I got out wasn't

exactly ideal Leonard was the one who

heard it first and he was the closest

thing I had to a friend in that place

Leonard Holden built like a barn and

about as complicated he'd worked on a

farm before signing up and sometimes it

seemed like that was about the limit of

what he thought the world was at least

until the rest of the world caught up

with him

poor bastard we've been captured at the

same time and the fact his head stuck

out above the others meant it was easier

for me to stick by him when we were all

getting sorted we pushed through those

four months together me watching him go

from a hulking farm boy into a scrawny

beanpole of a man he never lost his

smile though not until he heard that

music it was a cool winter night when it

happened they never got properly cold in

North Point not like back home but you

still ended shivering most of your

nights away there was the lightest of

rains that night when the nemesis

arrived we were trying to sleep pushed

into our cramped wooden huts thin

blankets pulled tight at first it was a

drumbeat distant regular sometimes

broken by the rattling role of a snare

drum I could feel my pulse quickened

like it wanted to match the tempo no I

have no idea why

I should have been confused scared maybe

in I guess I was but I could also feel

my fingers

tap tap tapping away to the beach and

beside me Len had started to hum to

himself tune I could almost half

remember hearing just before the trumpet

began to drift over the waters just a

few yards beyond the walls I call it a

trumpet because that's the closest thing

I can think to liken to that sound but

it sure wasn't any trumpet they played

on the parade ground by this point we

were all out of our beds and clustering

around the dirt caked windows looking

out towards the water I don't know if

any of us had any expectations of what

was going to happen but unless it was

some Japanese military thing I think we

were all expecting to watch some people

die and we did I guess just the way we

thought and there was a boat floating

out there not 20 yards in the shoreline

it wasn't like any Imperial ship I'd

ever seen but I didn't think it belonged

to our side either it was metal but not

like the warships I was used to it was

like an old tall ship with tattered

masts and rigging but made entirely out

of cold black iron I knew it was cold

it made me cold just to look at it the

whole thing Sean in the moonlight

slicked with water as though had been

caught in a rainstorm and I could see

the name written in English on the prow

clear as anything nemesis

it had been almost a full minute by now

and we'd still heard no response from

the guards no searchlights no lumps no

angry shouting none of the things that

usually accompanied any sort of

commotion that should have been a good

thing right but instead I just felt this

pit in my stomach like I knew whatever

was coming had to be really really bad

just then I saw figures moving towards

the shore even in the dark I could make

out the uniforms of our captors but they

weren't moving right they were stepping

slowly walking to the rhythm of the drum

swelling of the trumpet in another life

another reality it almost just said they

were dancing they kept going until they

stood at the water's edge I counted

dozens of them he must have been if

regarding the camp or damn near it they

were still moving around each other

still shifting and stepping to the

rhythm of that music but now something

was in their hands glinting in the

moonlight our captors held their blades

tight keeping them utterly still while

their bodies moved and swayed then in a

moment the control broke and they fell

on each other suddenly each crying out

with Unleashed ferocity one man severed

his commanders arm than a single swipe

before being run through the stomach by

his former comrade two more plunged the

points into each other's eyes pushing

forward driving them in until they both

collapsed propped up intertwined it only

took a few seconds and then they were

all dead and the dirt was slick with

their blood flowing down and into the

water where the Nemesis floated and when

they were lying still and the music

stopped night was quiet again that's

when I heard the sound that really

chilled my blood

all my comrades my fellow prisoners

cheered and it wasn't the chair of those

glad for freedom it was the sound of

bloodlust cruelty without any fear of

the guards

we left our cramped dormitories and

filed down towards the ship that all the

others seemed to think was our salvation

they walked slowly almost reverently

stepping over the bodies or our slain

jailers a few bent down pulling long

knives and bayonets from the corpses not

even bothering to wipe the trailing gore

from them small boats paddled over from

the ship have started to ferry us over

the sailors wore old uniforms a mess of

different navies different eras some I

recognized from history books others

were complete mystery to me all of them

had some telltale stain or burn or patch

of missing cloth something that made it

clear that whoever was wearing the

uniform was not the original owner it

took several trips to transfer her body

to nemesis but in all that time nobody

spoke it was surreal my whole time as a

prisoner had felt like a nightmare that

this this felt like something else

entirely

they lined us all up on the deck as if

we were mustering for something none of

us dressed or uniformed a few holding

salvaged weapons waiting to know what

was expected of us and the ship began to

sail out down towards the open ocean

wind and salt cutting through us as we

went my feet felt stuck to the deck

shivering as we watched this weird

mismatch of bloody sailors maneuver this

thing that seemed like it belonged to

the bottom of the sea

looking around I could see the metal was

twisted and bent in places and staring

closer at the deck below I began to

notice rust and holes laced through it

there was absolutely no way that this

vessel should have been floating after

an hour we completely lost sight of the

land and the only things beyond our ship

were the rollin black waters and the

hollow glow of a full moon that was when

the music started up again we were so

close now every pulse of the drum

shuddered through us and the trumpet

notes cut through us I could see now it

was made of the same black iron as the

ship and embedded like shrapnel in the

hand that held it the lips that blew

into it whatever spell have come over

the others was God in an instant and I

could feel the sudden terror flow out of

them in a flood of unleashed fear some

of them started to whimper others tried

to ask questions of anyone they thought

might be officers but they were ignored

and the music just got louder Leonard

was the first to dance well no I think

of it as a dance though I don't know why

he reached over and grabbed another one

of the former prisoners a scrawny guy I

think his name was Milton he gave a cry

of anger that I could never have

imagined coming from his gentle smiling

lips even in the heat of battle

there was nothing Milton could do even

malnourished as he was it was easy for

Leonard to snap his arm like a twig

twist his neck until his leg spasmed and

his skull started to crack

even when his victim was clearly dead he

kept beating it tossing the corpse

across the deck with as much ferocity as

if it were the most hated man alive

the bloody crew of the nemesis watched

their eyes riveted and their feet

tapping to the music

Leonard's rampage against the now

unrecognizable corpse of Milton only

ended when another soldier whose name I

never knew left for to that same cry of

violence and began to stab him wildly

with a stolen bear net so it continued

hour upon hour of that night as one by

one the stolen prisoners succumbed to

that music their silent frozen terror

giving way in a moment to the eager

desire to kill the crew hungry for death

in their stolen uniforms at first cried

out in joy with each new murder then

they cried out with expectation and at

last with what sounded like concern

casting their eyes up into the empty sky

as though waiting for something as fewer

and fewer of us remained I could feel

something like panic begin to spread

through them and I began to see the

water line creeping higher and higher up

the side of the ship reaching eagerly to

pull the Nemesis back down into its

grave the whole time I expected the

music to reach me to take me to seize my

heart with murderous purpose but it

never did even as the last of the other

prisoners began to hack wildly at each

other and the waters started to flow

over the sides and around my ankles I

never felt it

instead I broke and ran fleeing for one

of the smaller boats that had ferret us

from the shore the crew did not stop me

they simply watched me with expressions

of despair

the deepest disappointment I've ever

seen the small craft was iron like the

larger vessel and as the Nemesis sank

finally beneath the waves again I cut

the remaining ropes and simply floated

away no I was terrified I'd be picked up

by the Japanese or died out there in the

ocean but as it was I got lucky then a

few days later was picked up by an

allied ship I told them my story just

like I telling you now how much you know

I got to sit out the rest of the war I

often think about that night that it's

not the blood I remember not the black

iron ship or the look on Leonard

Holden's face as he pulled poor Milton

apart it's the sadness on the faces of

those who kidnapped us those who made us

dance to their violence I don't think

I'll ever know what they expected to

happen but I think I'm very glad it

didn't final comments well that's quite

a relief nearly 40 years I'd be

wondering about the slaughters ritual

keeping an eye out for anything that

might be stirring and it turns out I

needn't have been worried at all the

risen war failed a few years before I

was even born I should have known I

suppose few wars in my lifetime have

reached anywhere near the heights of

fear I suspect this ritual would need

though I did spend some time a while

back looking over some details from the

Cuban Missile Crisis to no avail and all

this time the answer was just sitting in

the archives of the song Ling Center

funny how that works sometimes an

interesting set of trappings for this

one

the opium war history of the Nemesis

uniforms linking no doubt to horrific

crimes from every Imperial nation all

placed in the bloody heart of the

Pacific Theater

and Japanese POWs something to do with

attitude towards surrender and atrocity

in Japan at the time the sin Jing Kong

military code and not my place to

speculate I suppose

still the anticlimax is fascinating I

can only assume they were supposed to be

bombed at the height of the ritual maybe

by Japanese aircraft

maybe Allied maybe both

I wonder what stopped it a Japanese

radar filled with spider webs the US

destroyer finding itself suddenly alone

in the open ocean we'll probably never

know I suppose hey any of them survived

the resyncing of the Nemesis God they

must have been kicking themselves in

1945 if they just had a bit more

patience which in a few years sails her

into Nagasaki Harbor instead still none

of us can tell the future can we so

that's nice another one to cross off the

list doesn't help with the unknowing

though well you still have declares

back-up plan of course but it's very

risky to be sure I think the detonation

would need to happen from within the

unknowing while it was going on Gerrard

may have a connection to the AI that I'm

not convinced it will be enough I will

admit I've grown fond of the boy I

wonder if I told him about Erick whether

he'd follow in his father's footsteps

still and it's not like it kept Erick

safe in the end anyway point is you can

probably discount the slaughter it had

its chance

so funny story turns out when Daisy

broke the lock to get into elias's old

office

well she did a good enough job that it's

not obviously broken so it hasn't been

replaced yet so I had a look around

mostly as I remember but there's a box

of tapes and statements in the corner

obviously those Elias either didn't feel

he could trust me with yet or maybe just

the ones he was checking himself ideally

I'd like to avoid tipping Peter off for

as long as possible that I have access

and it turns out I don't know Elias is

safe combination not yet anyway

so I just do it the first one that calls

to me and it's it's good I suppose

glad to know I don't need to worry about

a slaughter ritual nice to get

confirmation that whoever Erik was he

was Jerry's father and while one esteem

was Mary keys partner but nothing with

any direction to it ever since I crawled

out of that damn coffin I feel like I've

been adrift filling in blanks and diving

into history but only the breadcrumbs

I'm finding are stale old what the hell

is the Watchers crowned so far the only

mention of it I've had is from Jerry and

he didn't seem to know much about what

it actually meant and he's gone now but

if it is the grand ritual of the holding

then I I mean I need to know about it

right I feel like I'm on a deadline like

I'm running out of time somehow and I

don't even know where to go what to look

for or just casting around blindly for

more clues to just drop into my lap

everyone else is running towards

something or running away and I

I don't know what I'm doing I'm just

tired

think I might go lie down for a while

get a cup of tea Daisy's got me

listening to the archers I hate it but

it feels nice to hate something that

can't hurt me I don't know that's it I

guess end recording
