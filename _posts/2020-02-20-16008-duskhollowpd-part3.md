[Music]

hello for the third and final

installment of dust Colo PD I'm Johnny

from the Magnus archives you probably

know that if you're on this feed so if

this is your first episode of anything

in this feet stop go back to episode 1

of the Magnus archives if you just want

to know what is going on here go back to

episodes because this is part 3 and it

will be very confusing for you I am here

with some other people

I'm Laurie and I produce the Magnus

archives and I am playing Emma will ends

oh yes sorry this is a role-playing game

roleplay podcast where everyone is a

policeman in a weird town investigating

a murder

Oh weird murder and all those

investigators is me I'm action you all I

play mine in the podcast and I am

playing today

Archie Murdoch the person with an accent

that I kind of change based on the

circumstances who seems to be doing well

you're still young you know you you who

are those other voices we haven't been

introduced to now neither of you speak

that's how this works I'm sorry how rude

I'm Sasha

I play Georgie on the Magnus archives

and today I play Gabrielle Schreiber a

very skeptical detective who's following

leads whether they are present or not

and finally I am Frank I play basura in

the Magnus archives and today i am

playing detective car hustle bet who's I

mean largely his role right now is just

be covered in blood I mean yeah it's

probably not going to change no we

thought we'd you thought we'd shake

things up by having you play some kind

of police oh wait

so outside my comfort so when last we

left our heroes competent you had found

some clues about a body that involved

some trains question mark and then you

did some very embarrassing things that

have the chief yelling at your sergeant

but importantly not us no and as long as

as long as the sergeant isn't one of

those bosses that passes their

irritation and displeasure down the line

you should be fine I mean I'm sure being

at the very very bottom rung means that

the problems are never going to reach me

I'm sure he's given you 24 hours to

crack the case that's what you're gonna

do so I'm seeing here that we've got it

we've got a code right we've got a

whistle so is this what they mean when

they said like it's like a whistle

blower is this is that what we're

dealing with here kitty you really could

be I'm gonna take that coat and I'm

gonna cross-reference it with my

walenski you're in so much trouble

Judy rose off my back graveyard shift

off of this case is over all I hate the

graveyard shift is wet and damp and

lonely little to none it is like the

dust collar graveyard is interesting all

the graves are very old

no one ever actually seems to be buried

there there are sometimes you'll see

burial parties but they always look

basically like the same people clustered

around a grave there's no church there

aren't any churches of any religion in

dust kalo there is a gravedigger but you

know he's he just keeps to himself

mostly

you got tenure and just hasn't been

doing job since pretty much I'm gonna be

looking for codes in the time tables

using this code or the number that we

got from the inside of the dead man's

nine out of nine to two five one you

mean - no - Jeff oh yeah so there are

quite a lot of there quatl of 9f codes

but they none of them go any higher than

9f

9 - 2 5 0 this is very interesting so I

have a hunch yes go with a kit and so

I'm gonna go to the library but can I

have some salt first please Emma looks

so proud running out of salt

I don't transfer coming home I look at

you dead in the eye I'm so proud of you

I hand in my salt shaker oh yeah oh yeah

I knew you had a new kid hold it like

it's a live grenade and slowly walk out

towards the library holding this with

both okay you're leaving yourself

without salt look I think he needs it

more than I do I when you taught him

about the salt Julian's there are other

ways to find aliens okay what about

hustle back and free Bert what are you

up to well so far I have been you know

hassling the Mariners but I think I've

been the same leads real bad and doing

great work so it's definitely time for

me to reward myself with a coffee mm-hmm

I do have this receipt from Whiteley's &

Sons books and curios and it is right

next to my favorite coffee place so I

guess I'll swing by well in there you go

with Frank or are you doing your own

thing

following a maverick course yeah I

haven't made any notes so I'm just gonna

follow tree burn okay fair enough we

will start let's not equate leads okay

wait lien sounds books and curios is old

if you can imagine like a Victorian

Curiosity Shop dropped into a noir high

streets that's what it is

the window is full of rare tones strange

little antiques there is a stuffed tiger

a little cuddly tiger those looks at you

it's actually pretty cute you know I

said it a bit like it was creepy but

it's not actually he's just a cuddly toy

the bell rings as you push the door open

thank you very much angles and like

Charest oh very much so very much so

there's like there aren't enough lamps

in here and everything has quite stark

shadows this is either Chinatown kid or

is the owner is Helena bonham-carter

I can't decide wage but it's gonna be

one of them okay so is anybody come out

when the bell rings not immediately no

you can't see the desk it's it's sort of

behind various piles of old books and

and an old grand piano that is covered

in books

well I will kind of wander around making

sure that my footsteps are falling in a

very policie way you know okay as you

round a corner in the books

a man is there he's middling height but

very stooped just a very long face goes

down quite a way with little small round

spectacles

hello mr. Whalley and that's me useless

Wheatley what can I do for you what sort

of delights can i purvey to you this day

I'm afraid we're actually here about

some previously purveyor delights oh

dear

nobody's come to a horrible end are they

it's rather suspicious that you should

say that can I ask what led you to that

conclusion

it's just asking questions we'll ask the

question is press my idle curiosity

about the horrible deaths now might be

associated with things he's not unless a

man plans to give more information more

context I mean what is this about also

who are you are you buying anything

detective Schreiber oh the police

detectives yes I'm so dreadfully sorry

how very rude of me I always do my best

to cooperate fully with the police you

made a sale a little while ago there was

a

conductors hat No Deal and a timetable

here's a trend comer old not to be

confused with comic ancient or kama

undated or kama you sure I sell a lot of

interesting things well this isn't an

advert you're not on the radio would you

care to tell us about those particular

items were they have any interest could

you please make me a smokes roll I feel

like these have gone a bit too well for

me so far okay yes cost of course I can

please come this way

detectives he walks back round to the

other side of the desk pulls out a huge

old accountable it starts [ __ ] throat

now let me see various volumes sold for

thirty pounds no an old tandoor bird

sold for 200 pounds no could you please

make me a wisdom test against yes that's

a 10 under 13 okay yeah you're so she

already so yeah you could like you you

know that he's just stalling I'm gonna

wander around while he just takes his

time so much time going through these

records an old tobacco box comma old 15

pound no

oh sorry of course here we are

detectives

you have intimidation I believe as an

expertise could you've only smokes as

well actually you get advantage for

being covered in actual blood no I'm

surprisingly after that anything is

detracting seven makes it feel like oh

here we are

of course detectives train conductors

cap comma old fifty pounds

mm-hmm train timetable come on old

40-pound sold to a mrs. Angela grokken

two days ago now she was after train

memorabilia

I believe specifically those relating to

the British Rail standard class of train

fascinating fascinating business really

I mentioned Oh Kate these for her and

sold them along I did of course not know

anything about any purses or arcane or

eldritch properties that they may have

had and no such knowledge would be

provable on my part you can't see it but

I had just rolled my eyes very

powerfully no I saw that have you sold

any whistles recently no though

originally I believe there was supposed

to be a whistle that goes along with the

cap as a scent but whether it was ever

created who can say can you say I can't

know whether I can like I didn't get it

I didn't find a whistle though

apparently there was supposed to be one

with the cap as part of the set and

indeed the timetable detectives I've

been in this situation enough times

selling the harmless curios that I do

that sometime

may end up pivotal aspects of murder

scenes who can say but I've been around

I've done this dance enough times that

it is probably a good idea for me to

come clean I do have a second copy of

that time table I may have made myself a

copy that I can provide to you as long

as you remember how helpful I was to

dust called a police department I would

very much hate for anyone to think that

I was in any way involved with covering

up or trying to excuse any sort of

horrific crime I'm simply a humble

shopkeeper yeah under you mentioned that

you found this cap and time table where

exactly did you find it

oh where does anyone buy antiques here's

some dealers I'm acquainted with found

them in their own auctions often estate

sales washed up on lonely beaches where

do antiques come from did you have any

specific information about these

particular items you know that is all

you have to say yes well actually now I

think about it now I really think now

that I am so very keen to help out at

least one but I believe that these were

acquired from the old station master of

the dust collar train yard write that

down

we will provide you with a copy of an

old train timetable that is strange

actually lots of different train

designations but all of them have

arrival times and dates of this year

whatever year this might be in da Scala

it's hard to tell but it's definitely

this one sorry so when you say there for

this year is it for the bit of the year

that hasn't it's for the future yes but

on all train timetables for the future I

mean not those Souls antiques usually

always say of course it's an antique

table , present timetable , present ,

old yeah oh I see what the the issue is

with this Sarge is a misprint those can

be very valuable you know you get a you

get a book with a typo in it it's more

valuable because it's rarer dates it's

specific so this one it's a misprint hmm

on a quick glance does the 9f9 two two

five one schoiar yes

it's scheduled to arrive at eight

o'clock tonight hmm you should wait on

the train tracks just to be sure I will

not do that so let's cut the library

okay I brie is like a tall imposing

building lots of oak lots of beams of

light for a town the size of dusk oh no

the library is way too big and very

echoey i stride powerfully up and

utilizing my library card supplies I'm

not sure how supplies work but it's one

of the ones I found out what's your dice

d8 role of e8 to see if you brought your

laughter part 7 yes oh yes hello hello

what can I do for you this is the

library's voice laughter yes it's just

that that's the same voice that Johnny

uses when he pretends to be are cats I

don't know oh jeez and okay I'm Arthur

the librarian dusk hallo public library

what can I do for you officer so I live

with cancer that's all in order I am

looking for trained books because I've

got to research like a train

mmm well-trained books will be under t4

trained books you don't have any kind of

cross-referencing system I'm gonna

actually have library users and I

believe no this library we believe that

Dewey was a fool do you have an indexing

system that I can helps cross-reference

with no but I know where I am being

Dennis I mean dating right now over

there here I'll show you

he takes you over to a big wall with

little brass plaque

I mean trained books excellent well I go

outside daddy gets dark Oh before I

forget I pull out sake salt shaker and

just oh that's really not what I can't

work he was happily saying he was

blessed I'm so sorry I hate myself he's

feeling pretty salty about it hahaha

he sort of staggers away to go wash his

eyes out she was right that's the only

and PC that's reacted to salsa I found a

real okay I am gonna begin researching

the heck out of old trains make me a

flashlight roll come on d4

oh you only have a d4 left yep okay well

it's fine you got a three so three

that's enough so 9 f9 2 2 5 1 if you're

cross-referencing it with the old

British Rail standards well naturally

those were a particular brand of

locomotive that only 999 of them were

ever made officially the 999th one was 9

F - 9 - 2 5 0 so if there were to be a

train with the designation 9 F 9 - 2 5 1

that would make it the secret thousand

Slocum

okay okay so let's let's work with what

we know here we have a secret thousandth

locomotive we have a librarian who is

some kind of alien and we have someone

having a heart attack so big that they

exploded and then someone came in and

took their heart later and then they

sort of exploded hmm okay I go back to

the librarian who is presumably in I'm

okay I've washed my eyes out and clean

to help you again what what can you tell

me about local records on like I bring

up like this specific type of locomotive

and just like do you know where like

when they stopped being in commission

you know I don't really I mean if it was

anything to do with the scholar than I

imagine that any decommissioned trains

would have gone to the old train

graveyard the rail yard fantastic buy a

little bit more based on this

interaction backwards keeping my eyes on

because I know an alien when I see one

reacting to salt in the eyes like an

alien not a human learning I got this

are you letting anyone else know that

you're going to the train yard

well none of them have mobile telephones

I am going to go to the rotary phone

mm-hmm wait is there a chance that the

chief could pick up yes I'm going

straight to the yard oh no Mike or

anyone mm-hmm brilliant I'm gonna stick

with okay you're gonna stick with young

Alex I'm sure you mean young gotcha

Murdoch actually yeah okay I'm gonna

stick with grizzled old Alex playing

young Archie oh yeah you can approach

the rail yard it makes zero sense that a

town the size of dust Kahlo would have

such an extensive train graveyard but it

does it's maybe it's hard to tell

exactly how big it is but the fence is

remarkably easy to hop and you start to

wind your way through ancient rusting

carriages and hollowed-out locomotives

they're old lamps staring at you like

empty sockets of a skull hey what are

you looking for so this is feeling quite

sketchy so I'm gonna draw my salt mm-hmm

and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

I mean you do also have a shotgun as I

recall I see which way the winds blowing

do alien with a hint of salt so my logic

is I have expertise in engineering

mm-hm use me library in terms of

engineering it's like okay cool it's

this type of train it's a realistic case

on this gauge of track realistically if

it's gonna be in a train graveyard or

something similar then it's gonna have

to be in a certain type of shirt because

you have gauges I mean we're done where

that train would be if it was there yep

that's fine you can 100% do that yeah

it's so easy for you I'm not even gonna

go into details about how do you do

are you in any way sneaking or you know

okay great so as you get closer into a

nearby hill out of the train graveyard

is a tunnel dark tunnel just stretching

away into the hill and there is a track

that leads from it into the center of

the train graveyard

I stood there there are eight people

wearing hooded jackets that even the

gloom you can tell do any of them wear

like station hats at all it's hard to

tell as you're getting closer you feel

some strong arms gripping you either

side could you make a strength test

please I'm gonna say it disadvantage

because there are two of them am i able

to use my special ability of swings and

leaps being just vaguely acrobatic or is

this not an applicable one if you had

been like if you've been jumping from

train to train or something yes this is

just skate being nabbed strength of

disadvantage little did you know that's

the first one we got a seven on the

table 13 no I'd ruin your story you are

grasped I mean it's not my story you're

the one who decided to go to the train

yard without any backup

you are yanked backwards by two very big

guys in anoraks

what we got here looks like a looky-loo

no I'm I'm I'm a cop and I'm allowed to

go wherever I want cuz the Sarge says so

take

to the track we're on the track your

drag on the center one of the figures

and anoraks comes forward lowers the

hood and you see Angela drakul wearing a

station wearing a conductors cap I have

no no no you have no idea with a whistle

around terror this is entirely for the

the audience's name it with an old tin

whistle hung around her neck and what

can I do for you officer yeah the thing

with aren't you murder I don't really

care

time to the track please down there you

are tied to the track I keep yelling out

because I'm reading my stats and

thinking whoa anything I'm reeling out

on the track don't do that I swallowed

the other whistle it'll all go wrong if

you do that the figures around are not

chanting anything but they are each

scratching stuff into their own little

notebooks in a very specific rhythm cut

back to the rest of the smell oh jeez

well at least I would actually like to

use on my special abilities because I'm

just by myself yeah if you guys returned

to the police station yet Franken

well we've got our coffee so I guess so

yeah so they'll be returned to the

police station okay well I wanted to use

my special ability deductions okay yep

which is once per session you can apply

your powers of deduction and reasoning

to reach earth strange

conclusion and require the GM to provide

a hint to the next best step so the

thing about aliens they don't know how

humans work not really may get specific

obsessions specific things just stuck in

their brains not like humans and clearly

what's going on here is some of the

aliens have become obsessed with trains

is how they're communicating we may be

how they're communicating with each

other maybe they believe trains to be

the dominant life-form says they're so

much bigger and eat people yeah either

way

chances are they also need somewhere

inconspicuous to land their spacecraft

and if they're really into trains maybe

the old train graveyard would be where

they would be so do the three of us just

look at each other and go I mean these

two of like okay you guys walk in with

coffee just as you're like just as this

is dawning on you walk up you know he's

gonna see a train please get there by

8:00 yes the graveyard yes

I mean it's currently it's coming half

past seven

how long does it take to get to the

train yard about 20 minutes we really

fast at my police car I mean Romeo me

your police car as you hurtle through

the rain towards the graveyard when we

get closer to the graveyard I'll say

turn the siren off you don't want to let

them know we're here

if you hit the distance drones of a

monkey Tonka so you are currently tight

the tracks the rain beats down soaking

you through in the distance you hear the

sound of a police car and then it stops

my own Angela blows the whistle and it

resonates the trains and the carriages

around all the rusted old hulks start to

vibrate ever so slightly distantly deep

within the tunnel you can see just a

pinprick of light starting to approach I

would like to attempt to use my other

special ability so that I've blown it by

the time I get run over by a train I

would like to use my special abilities

MacGyver my once per session you can

improvise a solution to a situation

using available tools devices and

uncommon law ok so I am going to use to

see this is this is playing into an Alex

strength it's just me both on the fly I

happen to have palmed one of the

Marlboro Reds that we are from earlier

shop and as a results I've got that

sequestered along with the lighter now

it just so happens that Archie Murdoch

with his engineering knowledge knows

that there is an issue in these kind of

trade lines where a certain amount of

aluminium oxide can end up laid into the

track as a result of the soldering

process to make the rails

mhm so his logic is very simple which is

you can't burn through your ropes using

the cigarette it takes you long but what

he's doing is he's slowly occurring as

much dust as he can buying time to then

light the cigarette in hose of the

aluminium oxide firm at low fall and

then burn through the rope so that he

can men with the big bright light going

off from the thermite both escape and

run away as a distracting bright light

though you what you're doing we

absolutely clear I'm setting myself on

fire John oh you're you're trying to

burn some thermite underneath you yes

so while that's happening the police car

pulls up here screeches to a stop just

outside the train graveyard

I'm coming good well I was gonna suggest

oh yeah two of the anoraks look up and

look

gestures go sort it out I'm gonna draw

my Colt official police revolver yep

which I have special bullets if that is

acceptable to you which I have treated

with salt okay here's what I'm going to

say mm-hmm so your revolver is

technically a d6 rather than anything

else this this refer like this is an

ammo diet it determines when you're out

of ammo

if you've treated your bullets with

salts it is now a d4 because it's

probably going to jam okay okay good

thank you good to know oh by the way

just well no okay Shh you return to what

they were doing that's fine I'm not

gonna I'm gonna I'm just gonna choose my

moments so how are you guys getting in

well I have got lock-picking I can pick

any lock by making a flashlight rolls

might roll yeah this of this one of

those big old wire mesh gates

where's Maddy ten I think that it's very

snugly completely forgotten to get any

of you to make any sort of stress roll

why don't you no it's not aren't you

making stress rocks your train would you

let me to make you like three yeah go on

all right okay I'm on das actually no

role with disadvantaged so to d8 and

take the lowest okay for you fine

apparently this is apparently just not a

not an issue for you and also for too

much I mean like the library wasn't

really a stressful for me so I think I

think I'm kind of up to scratch yeah for

that fat okay so the gate swings open I

wouldn t roll in your by 5:00 p.m. for

the gate swings open the train graveyard

is quiet before you the rain beating

down in the distance deep in the

distance you can hear the whistle of a

train coming and I actually using this

opportunity to yell shoot them if

they're wearing perm jackets I run

towards the sound you see Angela give a

few the other train spotters are nods to

sent them off after these guys as you

round a corner you can see a train

spotter full anorak with what looks like

an Old World War two machine gun open up

on you could you please make a dexterity

18 dexterity 13 okay so you're taking

you owe me a d6 actually no make the d8

for how much damage you're taking okay

it doesn't actually hit you but you dive

to the ground and spread yourself up

like crazy a machine you can see other

train spotters approaching with the

other ones mainly seem to have knives

drawn like kitchen knives it's mainly

the knives that they found in kitchen

drawers and one of them has a machine

gun so what are you guys doing

lower you've already done yours because

if you had succeeded you would have got

an attack so what are one of the things

the Cthulhu hack does is rather than

having enemy attacks and player attacks

you what you choose what you're doing

you make a roll if you're successful and

you damage them if you're not successful

they don't interview and there are a

couple of additional ones because there

are more of them they will get one or

two extra attacks on so write what

you're doing I want to try and find the

leader of this little

that would be Angela she is currently

standing over Archie blowing our whistle

that likes getting closer Archie it's

fine I've got my firm I sold my know so

I can see that he's not at the moment

there are a couple of train spotters

between you and the punch these trains

was that was a brilliant that would be a

strength check Oh

is it supposed to be under under your

strength okay yeah what's your damage

it is a d8 fantastic role of the eighth

one I mean you like shove him any sort

of staggers back play is like what just

want him out of the way he's out of the

way has a knife in his life stab you so

Sasha I'm gonna be trying to you like

hop up onto trains and then run across

them to basically like a voyage the

ground you should get there real quick

it made me a dexterity roll okay I got a

20 that is by 12 which so you climb up

off the top of the Train and

unfortunately standing there is just the

biggest anorak you've seen with what

looks like you know those gardening

implements that you sort of dig in and

used to pull up weeds yeah got one of

them needs stabs wrong me a d-10 bad -

okay so if oh so they're a couple of

others who are charged with nice one

will go for alphabet and one will go for

Wilensky so that you both many strengths

roles I'd help I'm here to raise the

stakes

sorry guys

I got 17 so my strength is 14 yes sir

you're fine you'll find you manage to

just like kick him away you get a little

bit more stamped and just this will just

be a d6 I think three that's three down

down to six you want to be Tyson's train

track much safer soothing

apparently so oh my fur my plan going

you've got enough if you want to if you

want to if you want to light it Archie

yells out because Archie knows that

thermite burns really brightly oh oh

geez

hey everybody look over here oh and then

lights the thermite okay so maybe like I

would I would ask you to make a saving

throw but you're lighting some thermite

under you not a little bit okay so what

I'm gonna say is please roll me a deep

ten for how much damage you take if you

roll one or a two you do not burn

through the ropes if you were if you all

for your above you burn through the

ropes you are also taking this much

damage to be clean oh this is great

Wow okay how much have you got it's

gonna say okay so I can kill myself with

this in fact there's a solid chance I'm

killing myself with this so I have seven

hit points I have done myself six hits

so there is a bright light as op she's

macgyvered thermite ignites igniting the

ropes igniting him you are and you are

very much on fire I'd rather have the

goo oh man oh geez but say you very

least you afraid I immediately try to

run off on the fire away from the Train

that's clearly gonna crush me before I

burn to death from the fire I let myself

see approaching now it's stuck as you go

up you can see reflected down the tunnel

a locomotive of black glass up

oh good god and a reasonable claim yeah

I'll take the bear my burns thanks

glowing green smoke billowing from the

stack can we all see it no you're not

there yeah I am you can get there now if

you'd like yeah I'm still running to get

it

okay so I'll say that you can reach them

are you attacking any of the

transponders or are you what do you what

do you do I'm saving all of my salt

bullets for that train that's coming

towards us cuz it's clearly an alien oh

my god

I mean I'm gonna say you can see the

Train if you want to take a shot at the

train just go for it don't try to shoot

the train what's my role - guarantee it

would be flesh not damage no I mean

you've got hate at first

oh yeah of course sorry ODI of duck 78

what if you miss the train okay

could you roll me well armed I have a

decent yep so that's a d6 damage but

you're using salt on it so that's a d6

damage d4 for the ammo oh sorry I'm with

you three okay grant is assault damage

yes clearly a supernatural alien drain

it has green smoke yes it is but it's

also no venerable - salts bullet hits

the huge train

could you please just call me Adi for

three there you go still working so

Frank

well I was trying to get to Rocco I will

say that you can you can reach her you

just shouldering your way past the the

transporters with you yeah

the machine gun one is gonna try and hit

you so whatever you do this turn if you

fail you're gonna

little bit machine-gunned I'm gonna try

and grab a yeah okay make me Australia

check oh I also want to try and rip the

whistle off from around the neck you

know always if you wanna go through the

whistle that's dexterity if you want to

just grab her that strength I am gonna

say however that she is currently

supernaturally empowered by the oncoming

train and so you will be would you seen

your strength no no no no shooting the

train with a pistol with some salty

bullets from a pistol action that was a

brain rifle at the tree I was a great

battery I'm gonna go for the whistle you

me but can I use my ripped ability

Sarala advanced are you saying that you

want to be so muscles that you just

you're assuming okay that Frank's saying

that they want to grab by the hand it

could be advantage do it grab it with

your packs that was a 16 it's not enough

I mean I mean it's too much hmm she sort

of takes a single step back damn it

think of that trouble is like it's your

very strong but not super flexible

because of all the muscles like a

sticker stuck between the shoulder

sessions okay so I'm up five presumably

because I'm up higher I can see what's

going yes you can

okay I want to go for ironic try and

just run proud Angela Bravo also sorry

you also got machine guns I forgot I'd

said that so could you roll a d-10

but you're in disguise yeah you get a

little bit machine gun or damage what do

you say I want to run for Angela groffle

and put the cuffs on her and make me

kill a dexterity roll 10 under 12 okay

so you couldn't you get on that and then

take in the Western guys see the cuffs

go round you're holding her the Train is

literally 20 feet away I'm barreling

towards you I have satin paper on that

you're on the track she was standing on

the track the track train is that'll be

your next turn aren't you what are you

doing

am I still on fire yes I stop drop and

roll away from the tracks okay you are

no longer on fire

that is your turn vilensky unless you

want to try and save Schriever but you

would take some fire just just a choice

just a choice I'm thrown out what are

you doing I'm not a rugby tackle sorry

but off the okay strength check if you

fail this you are all getting hit by a

train I rolled away from the tracks how

not you and not not massage but like the

two are on the track people you try to

help them rescue me I have nothing

that's gonna help me with this

okay so now I thought this would go you

leap tackling both of them with one hand

yank the whistle off a brothel with the

other hand throw the cap away I saw

words I thought as you like as you do

you can feel something else snap along

with the cord not something physical

this mean reality and the train sort of

starts to shatter with little bits of

glass question for the video are we

pepper ding glass die hardstyle where

it's like oh no a bit a glass we're

peppered in glass like reality star is

like oh god we're all in ribbons it's

glass it's spiel awhile since you've

seen die hard isn't it it messes him ah

oh I was thinking more like terminator

or something it's yeah like it's a might

like you're fine anyway it'll probably

do a few points of damage to these guys

but I don't think enough to kill them

okay that's kind of the rest of the

Train supporters start to scatter I

shout I knew it right we want to make as

many arrests as we can right now come on

you for the murder of Jeffrey Mariner so

you can be going around

yeah I'm tighten up a few other

transponders and yep you sort of cuff

her sit her down a couple of minutes

later in walks the judge flanked by a

few members of the town council oh geez

no no yeah he gives you a look have you

by made the arrest

I did your honor detective Schreiber

what are the charges

murderer Jeffrey marina what is the

evidence she had been corresponding with

the deceased right your honor I've just

I'll lay it out for you I've got it all

figured out right okay

please explain the crime as though there

were some audience who

fully filled which in many ways there is

because it is me the judge yes your

honor

so Angela groffle several years ago her

husband dies and here's what she does

she sets her sights on a young heir and

she secretly marry Cynthia has to be a

secret sir because she knows the she is

like a kind of middle class this is only

ridiculous I was trying to summon a

demon train okay it's very simple there

was a demon train which ate my husband

years ago he was one of the original

train spotters and he was trying to

summon the train from power the power of

steam but his hubris costumers life and

I discovered a way bring it back but the

whistle the whistle died with him so I

had to reman efest the whistle so I

tricked that fool I didn't love him I

didn't marry him he's not an alien and

he was just yes

I mean that's got nothing to do with

anything the possession of Mara our

affair is completely tangential of this

whole time I knew it anyway point is I

try to something - do you train under

women who are derailing your confession

thank you for confessing you want your

colleagues very irritated yeah yes

sergeant I think I do one second guilty

he slams a gavel down on nothing in

particular it rings out and the members

of the town council to sort of walk over

pick up Angela Carter away yes what did

you want sergeant you've met my um

detectives land of that one your life

yes

a transfer that's I don't work for the

police -

put in a word that you understand and I

think it would be good quick baby my

help that's made assault I will not

he turns around and leaves case closed

everyone I know as a success cuz
