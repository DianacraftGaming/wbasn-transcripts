knock yourself out

right course if anyone else ever hears it you'll arrest me 

no 

right and 

so you came to deliver one of the tapes from Basira the the the audio tapes so can I have it please 

I'm thinking 

right 

I thought you needed me to check them 

you  don't get it do you

I'm not sure I follow 

the tapes 

why is

she was giving them to you she 

she wanted my help 

you didn't have a tape player your station 

she thought you did it 

what 

we both did 

wait you thought I killed Gertrude 

yes

why 

look at you you're obsessed with it jumpy is Helena the only person who benefited from her death 

I mean I didn't

yeah I know 

finally got IT to clean up the CCTV for the week she disappeared no cameras in the archive but we got plenty of footage of you watched your movements that whole week you didn't kill her

I don't what does this have to do with the tapes 

didn't have enough to hold you Basira was worried you were going to run 

so what you fed me a couple of tapes to keep me around 

yeah 

and now you know I'm innocent 

hmm 

I reckon we should cut you off but Basira is soft she likes you 

no idea why maybe she keeps feeding you tapes 

doesn't involve me 

I don't plan on seeing or hearing anything about it 

well thank you detective Tonner 

Daisy

Thank You Daisy 

sure if you don't mind me asking how long have you been section

I do mind 

14 years 

I just posed you'd like to make a statement about what whatever you like 14 years you must have seen any number of paranormal things

and you want me to tell you about them okay 

what 

okay I'll give you a statement about how I got my first section 31 

you look surprised 

I think I was largely asking as a formality 

Basira didn't give the impression you were the sharing sort 

maybe you caught me in a good mood

right well good do you need me to go over our non-disclosure policy 

it's not 

as long as you understand my policy 

if it gets out I'll break every bone in your body 

what 

nothing

statement of detective Alice Daisy Tonner of the London Metropolitan Police

what's the subject 

traffic stop of a delivery van on the m6 near Preston afternoon of 24th July 2002 recorded live from subject verse December 2016

statement begins 

this was a long time ago 

I'd been police for two years 

I wasn't even with the map back then 

I was based up in Lancashire with a road policing unit 

this is before the Highways Agency took most of the grunt work so there was plenty to do 

none of it much fun but it needed doing 

looking drunk drivers of my favorite 

I always hoped they'd refuse the breathalyzer maybe even took a swing at me 

nothing funnier than a drunk asshole trying to avoid being arrested 

I usually rode with Isaac masters he'd been working with the rpu a lot longer than I had and was even harsher than me 

I know why though he tried to be a good police give everyone a fair shot but you see a lot of accidents 

not much worse in the world and a really bad car crash it gets to you 

you get harder people who don't respect the road and there are plenty of them out there

I'm raining that night that heavy thumping rain that means you can't hear a damn thing it crashes onto the roof like someone's jump in on it

me and Zach was sitting in a lay-by watching traffic and trying to drink coffee he'd picked it up from a service station a few miles back but it was one of those open-topped styrofoam cups 

by the time we got back to the car the rain had got in and left us with two cups of cold sludge 

so it was in a pretty bad mood there's maybe 1:00 in the afternoon but you wouldn't have known it the clouds weren't letting any Sun through and everything looked great wet and lifeless 

we're going to even talk over the sound of rain on the roof so we just sat there in silence drinking lukewarm sludge 

the motorway was quieter than normal a Wednesday afternoon doesn't see a lot of traffic but the rain usually brings out more cars that day he was pretty empty 

everyone seemed to be driving careful on account of the rain which was also not normal and I was torn 

part of me wanted to spot some idiot who I could take my bad mood out on when the other part of me didn't want to get any wetter than I already was 

he looked like I wasn't gonna get a choice anyway 

at least not until I saw the van 

he was a beaten up old Citroen C 15 

there was some writing on the side but I couldn't see it clearly through the rain 

it was either very dirty or painted and nasty shade of off-white most

importantly it was driving about 25 miles an hour the limit is 70 there's technically no minimum speed on a motorway but the van didn't show any signs of speeding up and it was kind of strange

we had enough cause to stop it if we wanted I wasn't sure whether to let it go or not but Zack had clearly made his decision already he was in the driving seat and fired up the lights as we drove up behind it

the van glided to a stop on the hard shoulder at the side of the road and sat there the headlights which had been turned on for the rain died then it just waited

Zack was out first the rain was so thick that he had to take his torch to see properly. the light passed over the van and I could see rust creeping around the edges of the paneling. 

we walked up to the driver's side. I could see dark shapes from inside but they weren't moving. up close I could read the name on the side: "Breekon and Hope Deliveries"

was covered in a thick layer of dirt that the rain couldn't quite wash off

Zack knocked on the door and it opened the man who got out looked normal - so normal that these days I can't really picture his face. said his name was Tom

I wasn't the one looking over his driving licence so I don't know about second names 

from the other side two men climbed out 

they were huge hard faces like a pair of old stone statues dressed in overalls and flat caps

the arts what was going on speaking back and forth in cockney accent so broad and fake sounding that I thought they were putting them on for a laugh

I was about to lay into them for it when a sound cut me short so I could be talking to Tom who was making some bland explanation for his slow driving - caution heavy rain empty Road all that crap 

they heard it too and he stopped mid-sentence to look at me from the back of the van there was a sound of moaning it sounded like kind of like a moan of pain but long and drawn-out 

it went on for almost a full minute and was almost I don't know kind of musical 

I looked at Tom and the fake cockney passengers but their faces were unreadable

that gripped Tom firmly by the arm and led him to the rear doors of the van demanding that he open it 

he didn't resist just nodded and got out a set of keys he put one of them in the door turned it and the van opened 

I saw that the two big guys had walked up next to us so I was getting ready for trouble but there's no way I would have guessed what was in there 

it was a coffin an old wooden coffin rough unvarnished 

I could see splinters where the nails had been hammered in 

badly wrapped all around it was a thick metal chain ending in a heavy padlock 

that weird moaning was coming from inside 

it was the only sound that cut through pounding rain 

I tensed up, reaching for my baton. 

if these people were kidnappers or worse, we would be in big trouble. 

I was ready for a fight, but they just stood there, not moving, staring at us. everything about the situation felt wrong. I looked over at Zack and he seemed to be thinking the same thing. 

he looked over at the 2-million overalls and told him to take it out then looked over to Tom asking if he had a key to the padlock 

reaching into his jacket, the man who called himself Tom pulled out a large iron key and handed it to my partner. didn't it like the other keys. I wanted to head back to the car and call in some backup, but Zack was a senior officer, and if he thought we should open it first, I was going to buck his play 

Zack took the key and walk towards the coffin which now lay on the wet tarmac lit only by the headlights of our car. the moaning was louder now, almost drowning out the sound of the hammering rain. water had begun to flow off the wood, but everything else about it was still. 

he got closer I could see the words do not open scratched into the surface of the wood 

they didn't look like my partner was paying them any attention though. he gently placed the key into the lock wincing slightly as he touched the metal and turned it. the chains snapped off like they were spring-loaded. they whipped around violently and Zack jumped back slipping and falling on his back I brought my baton up just in case the strangers made a move but they were motionless 

the moaning had stopped, the only sound was the creaking of hinges as the lid of the coffin began to move. it was slow the gap appearing first is just a crack before finally opening completely 

it was too dark to see what was inside at first, but when I shone my torch inside, I heard that gasp. I think I did as well. 

inside of that wooden coffin there was a staircase. it went down apparently into the ground below and seemed to go on as deep as I could see they were steep carved out of what looked like solid stone, and the rock that made up the walls didn't match the wet tarmac around us. all the earth that would have been underneath it 

it was completely impossible. I tried to ask Tom or his companions about it I yelled at them to explain what the hell was going on but they just stood there staring at it so I hit one of them with my baton 

it was really a larger man overall though I'm not sure which one it was like hitting solid wood and the blow jarred my arm badly making me drop the only weapon I had even then he just stood there staring at the casket there was a sound of movement from behind me I turned to see Isaac walking into the coffin, his torch shining into the hollow below 

he'd already disappeared up to his waist and there was this look on his face that I have never seen before, relaxed like he was asleep 

I shouted for him started a run but I've had a huge hand gripped my shoulder I grabbed it was my good arm tried to escape it but the grip was too strong the texture of the flesh was like a hard wrapper

all I could do was watch as my partner kept walking into the earth on stairs that couldn't be there after a few seconds he was completely out of sight 

I expected to hear something shouting a scream something but it was still just the rain the lid closed very slowly and then he was gone just a coffin sitting on the hard shoulder of the m6 

the hand released my shoulder is a two minute overalls began to walk over and calmly wrapped the chains back around it I thought the sudden bursts of anger and picked up my baton 

I lunged at them but the one closest to me moved quicker than I would have thought possible 

his best slammed into my chest like a cannonball and I felt a couple of ribs break 

I collapsed to the floor just lay there there's Tom and the two men locked the coffin back up loaded it into the van and drove off I never saw isaac masters again 

when I called it in I was expecting a manhunt and investigation some kind of justice it wasn't like we didn't have plenty of leads. instead I was handed a form I didn't recognize told to sign it and then reassigned to the mat 

since then it's been one spook story after another 

right thank you are you quite all right

no 

and I told that story to anyone except my old sergeant 

I'm not sure 

I should go

yes of course I'll see you out 

there is one other thing I've been meaning to ask Basira but you might not have done do you know anything about vampires 

yeah 

oh

it's just that a while back there were some problems arrested regularities around a few missing person cases 

suspect being released without properly tarah Gatien 

recordings of the interviews showed the subject wouldn't say a word but the officers doing the interview would let them go anyway 

I don't have a details of the investigation but there's a new operating procedure now which would be cases matching certain parameters have to be monitored by another officer outside the room five video in a very specific circumstance where the suspect says nothing but the interrogating officer acts as though they have there immediately removed from the room then they call me 

just you 

there are a few others around who did it but I take care of it doesn't also precinct I cuff the suspects hands and legs drive them out into the middle of Epping Forest and burn them to ashes 

there's never enough left to be a problem 

I don't know if they're vampires exactly but that's what we call them 

good lord 

how many have you taken care of 

Oh fire you've in the last nine years 

I see don't tell this hero

she doesn't know about that procedure

I'm not sure how much she'd understand

she's not cut out for that kind of work

of course I won 

don't tell her any of this 

okay 

I was never here 

if she wanted to get you more tapes that's her business but you keep this visit to yourself got that 

of course 

good

supplemental 

that was an interesting into you it seems we're not done with sinister coffins just yet. the contents were surprising to say the least but don't give any real clues as to its origin and purpose or even its relationship with Breekon and Hope. are they simply Korea's guardians hostages at least 

I also have confirmation that the vampires Trevor Herbert described and not purely figments of a drug-addled mind. I probably shouldn't be too pleased to discover that there are even more violent hunters stalking us through the night but there it is 

I'll admit to feeling a bit hurt by Basira's true motivations. I suppose it's hardly surprising. I have not been the most stable over these last few months 

either way I'll not be bringing it up 

even if I wasn't genuinely somewhat afraid of detective Tonner such a revelation would only harm her relate 

and I need those tapes 

I can't afford to have Gertrude's time of the Institute disappear back into obscurity 

I'll check the one I have and then wait to hear from Basira 

what 

perhaps I should try to make contact 

I should really have gone a number or something

well that's a matter for later I need to go home tried to get some sleep

I just wish it wasn't raining
