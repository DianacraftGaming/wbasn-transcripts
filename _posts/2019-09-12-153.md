statement of Barbara Mullins regarding

her nine months spent with the divine

chain cult original statement given a

second April 2012 audio recording by

jonathan sims the archivist statement

begins everyone thinks they're too smart

to get involved in a cult

I'm sure you do you think that of the

first mention of aliens or the end of

the world or the lost book of the Bible

where Jesus buried his holy staff in the

foothills of the Himalayas you'd go

running trouble is that misunderstands

how it works I mean when I was with the

divine chain some of the smartest people

there were also the most committed

intelligence doesn't make you less prone

to taking on bad ideas it just makes you

better at defending them to other people

and to yourself smart people can believe

some truly ridiculous things and then

deploy all the reason and logic at their

disposal to justify them because a

belief doesn't begin in your mind

it begins in your feelings the cults are

very good at finding you when you're at

your lowest point when you're your most

emotionally vulnerable when you're at

that point it's astounding

what can crawl into your heart it's not

a Fester there I hit my lowest point

when I turned 41 that's when my life

came crashing down at least on the

inside from the outside I'm sure

everything looked pretty much okay I was

getting gigs I had a job I had plenty of

friends and a supportive family but that

was when I started to properly look at

my life and I really didn't like what

was looking back I was a stand-up

comedian you see and a really good one

that's not boasting that's just the

truth and I'd always assumed that that

was enough to eventually have real

success and for the first 10 years it

seemed like I was right

I worked my way up

performed for basically nothing

basically every night and got to be

pretty successful and then I stayed that

way for the next 10 years

trouble is do you know how much a pretty

successful comedian makes let's just say

I had a full-time office job or was

still barely making rent but between

working full-time and gigging full-time

I just kept putting off everything else

in my life always so sure the big time

was just around the corner this is the

TV spot that gets me noticed this is the

sell-out fringe show that makes me

mainstream this is the deal that

actually goes somewhere I made it

through turning 40 with my self-image

intact but for some reason at 41 I just

cracked I realized I've spent most of my

life with nothing to show for it but a

few awards no one cares about a string

of awful comedian exes who broke up with

me for being funnier than them a nun

dreadful office job I was going to be

working until I died because I'd never

bothered to build a stable career I was

never going to own a home they were

going to have kids never going to have

the life I'd spent my entire youth

sacrificing for and yes I know that 41

isn't actually too late for most of that

but try telling that as owners just

decided they've wasted their life I felt

like I couldn't talk to anyone about it

my friends were all comedians who really

didn't want to hear it my family were

blindly supportive to the point of

uselessness oh they had plenty of

soothing platitudes but platitudes

wouldn't get me back 20 years I was in a

really bad place then a friend

recommended a meditation course to me

but I thought I'd give it a shot

obviously the meditation course didn't

mention anything about the organization

behind it I had no idea it was anything

other than a standard evening class and

it had exactly the right level of pseudo

mystical nonsense to it to get me

comfortable a little bit of Tarot

imagery here some misinterpretation of

chakras there a touch of sweet-smelling

incense to tie it all together and you

have a meditation class that is exactly

my lab

I mean let's put it like this I don't

believe in the power of crystals but I

still have plenty dotted around my

bedroom I don't believe in astrology but

I do have my birth chart on my wall and

like to check my horoscope Sun Sign and

ascendant every day just for fun of

course

anyway the meditation part of it was

actually really good I'd never had much

luck silencing my mind

but Joyce the lady running it was really

good at bringing you to that space it

was surprisingly freeing I started

attending regularly one thing she

insisted on was the start of each

session we would all sit in a circle and

tell the others what we liked about each

other only compliments only truth the

first few sessions no one really knew

the others well enough to offer anything

more than general niceties but as it

went on and we became closer the

affirmations became more personal more

meaningful and it felt really good just

to have all that positivity that

affection uncritically directed at you I

thought it would be cheesy but it was

just this incredible feeling of being

wanted and appreciated you know every

comedian goes on about how they love the

business how great everyone is every one

of them is lying it's horrible and

everyone in it is horrible and being

there having people be genuinely lovely

to me I didn't know what to do with

those feelings

apparently in organizations that monitor

cults this method is called love bombing

I think I'd even heard of it somewhere

before without in making any less

effective I went to the meditation group

for about three months before Joyce

mentioned a spiritual retreat she wanted

us all to go on he was in America a

small community out in rural Arkansas

and all our expenses would be taken care

of that should have sent alarm bells

ringing but by that point I trusted her

so implicitly that I was just excited I

will have to buy my own ticket

I won't bore you with the details of the

rest of my indoctrination once I got to

the divine chains community or compound

to use the classic term though there

weren't any fences or watchtowers it

suffice to say that there was more

friendliness support meditation and you

know what really good food

I'm told that Arnold used to be a chef

before they recruited him and well very

much helped their cause I also met the

leader of the organization Claude Villa

Kazi and he was so nice people talk

about charismatic dictators or cults of

personality but honestly you don't even

know what charisma is until you meet

someone like Claude everything you say

is valid and important you are always

worthy of his time and you know what

deep down you just think the same way I

mean even now after everything I still

miss listening to him talk the divine

chains philosophy was pretty simple

throughout history there have been ten

great links holy figures of divine

wisdom who were the manifested will of

humanity to understand and better itself

all the heavy hitters you'd expect on

the list Buddha Jesus Muhammad Rama

Krishna you get the idea they weren't

reincarnation x' per se but the same

divine impulse for human elevation

manifested in different people claude

villa Kazi was definitely not claiming

to be the eleventh link Oh No but he had

had a vision that the eleventh was soon

to be born and that he was to be their

Herald and guardian the actual practices

were a grab bag of all sorts of

occultism exactly what you'd expect from

a group who laid claim to basically

every major religion honestly I don't

know how much I actually believed any of

it but I felt like I belong to there I

sold what little I had in order to fully

earn my place in the community and I

stayed

I had shelter food all the companionship

I could ask for I spent my days working

in the field we actually produced one of

the only American rounds of rice-wine

which was how the cult made most of its

money and it felt good to be working

with my hands when the whole thing

collapsed the papers made all sorts of

awful claims about the place but I don't

know if they were wholly made-up or if

they happens the whole time and I just

didn't notice or if they came about

after things started to change started

to go rotten I wasn't there when they

found the dog maybe if I had been things

would have been different he was

actually Joyce and a few others who

stumbled across it while working the

fields the way they told it it was thin

and emaciated barely able to walk and

clearly suffering from some sort of

sickness but there was something in it

that drew them closer as Joyce put it we

couldn't help but love it they took it

to Claude who was just as taken with the

thing and decided to adopt it he named

the dog agape in front of everyone and

took it into his private room to be

cared for that was the last I saw of the

thing in her honestly I kind of forgot

about it for the next few weeks but that

was the moment when things started to

get really weird

Claude announced it evening meal a few

days later that he had been dreaming of

xi and there were going to be some

changes to help spiritually prepare us

for their arrival we needed to achieve a

state of pure love and to begin with

what that meant was that whenever we

would meet one another or pass each

other in the corridor or fields we were

to tell each other that we loved them

and Claude said solemnly you have to

mean it

at the time it didn't seem so sinister

and we all began to do it without

question until a week later when I

bumped into Mary outside the showers I

told her I loved her and began to walk

on when her arm shot out and grabbed him

by the shoulder she spun me to face her

and looked me dead in the eye I don't

believe you she said I mean she was

right she and I had never really got on

just two different personalities but in

that moment I was suddenly terrified of

what might happen if she thought I was

lying about it so I said it again and I

tried very hard to mean it her eyes

bored into me and I noticed that they

were yellow and sickly though she had

really bad jaundice and she nodded once

turned and left it was about that time

that the rice wine started to go bad

every batch we brewed came out cloudy

and undrinkable we couldn't figure out

what was going on I spent so long

cleaning every piece of equipment over

and over again but it just kept

happening when we raised it with Claude

or any of the others in the inner circle

they would nod understandingly then tell

us it didn't matter that it was no

longer our concern now that the 11th was

so close all the others seemed to accept

this without question and I didn't feel

I could press the matter without drawing

negative attention something I was

desperate to avoid doing so I just sat

there as it grew bitter cloudy and

rancid nobody bothered to get rid of the

wine and the smell gradually began to

permeate through the building those

closest to Claude began to change as

well everyone in the community had

always been very touchy-feely but now it

seems like they were always touching

each other or holding hands or in some

way pressing their skin to each other

even at mealtimes or in situations where

it seemed really awkward a few times

they touched me

hugged me or shook my hand and each time

I could feel myself struggling not to

recoil they'd stare at me with their

yellowing eyes and their skin was dry

and somehow sticky when I pressed it he

yielded ever so slightly like there

wasn't anything solid inside even then I

didn't think to leave I couldn't figure

out what was going on but I trusted

Claude so completely I couldn't imagine

it was truly harmful then came the day

when he announced that xi had arrived I

expected cheers excitement but instead

there were just murmurings of resolve

and determination as though a difficult

task lay ahead

Claude asked who was going to be the

first to meet them everyone went quiet

awed by the sudden opportunity for

divine benediction he walked up and

gently touched Joyce on the cheek and

she smiled with a happiness more pure

than I'd ever seen on a human face we

formed into a long line a chain holding

hands with Joyce at the very end of it

it stretched from one end of the

building to the other I was at the other

end so didn't see what happened when she

walked to Claude's private chambers but

as she did something passed down the

line I don't know how to describe it

really did you ever do that experiment

in science class where you held hands in

a line and the teacher passed a very

gentle electric shock down through the

students feeling of a charge going

through you it was like that but what

passed through us was warm and slick and

seemed to flow through my body like oil

and out into the ground

everyone felt it their blissful smiles

made me feel even more nauseated than

the sensation itself I never saw Joyce

again each day after evening meal Claude

chose someone else to meet to the 11th

each time the same process the same

daisy-chaining of hands at the end the

same sick feeling sliding through me

another member of the community gone the

line getting shorter a fear fell over

the others and at first I thought it was

the same fear that I had but when I

heard them talk of it what they feared

was that they wouldn't get chosen that

somehow this chance for pure divine love

would pass them by and I suddenly came

to the realization that perhaps I didn't

belong here like I thought I did so one

night I decided to see for myself

I waited until after lights-out and

slipped from the dormitory through the

empty corridors towards Claude's private

rooms the moon was right through the

window costing everything in stark pale

shadow as I got close I began to smell

it

he wasn't rancid not like the wine but

sweet like overripe fruit or sugar

that's cooked too long I found myself

standing in front of the understated

wooden door that I'd now seen almost a

dozen people disappear into my hand

reached slowly for the handle when I

heard someone moving behind it

no it wasn't someone moving it was many

people I'm sure of it the sounds of

dozens of limbs moving and stepping and

shuffling in unison then laughter

then we paint then movement again I

looked down at my shaking hand and saw

that seeping under the door was

something slick and colorless a greasy

residue that smelled overpoweringly of

that sickly sweet odor I took a step

back suddenly nauseated and almost fell

into the arms of Claude who would

silently come up behind me he held me

for a moment looking with such intensity

that I felt like he was weighing my soul

his expression unreadable then he sighed

and shook his head you do not belong

here you are not worthy of its love

leave even after everything I'd seen I

can't tell you how deeply those words

hurt me I turned and I ran out of the

building out of the compound out into

the night I ran until I reached a road

then sat there shaking until a passing

car took pity on me and took me down to

the local sheriff's office eventually my

case got passed up the line apparently a

few different government agencies were

interested in the divine chain mainly

for possible tax fraud and my testimony

was pretty much exactly what they needed

to go in there and check it out they

didn't tell me what they found until

after I'd had a few sessions with a

psychiatrist who specialized in cult

deprogramming and I'm sure it wouldn't

be hard to find out most of the details

online I'm pretty sure it made national

news there is one thing however that I

think they lied about the reports

detailed a mass grave in the rooms of

Claude Villa Kazi with bodies mutilated

and mixed together some who'd been dead

for weeks but I don't believe that

whatever was in that room I am

absolutely sure that when the

authorities arrived it was still alive

I just don't know what alive means when

it comes to something like that it

doesn't matter though the compound was

destroyed in an accidental generator

explosion and everything was gone it's a

part of me that's glad a sick little

part that's happy that whatever love was

there whatever I couldn't be a part of

is gone from the world no one else gets

it either statement ends I swear I

almost find the cult dedicated to the

dark powers of fear easier to understand

in the more mundane sort at least they

have some consistency this well the

corruption at work if I had to guess

though with unsettling echos of flesh

leanness I suppose oh yeah I think I

think you should probably get down here

hello lad here whistles sit down oh we

check if you're still human enough to

believe you've got something about

someone took him right from under our

noses in our own house I call that rude

don't you Jerry wasn't your horse you

had no right you hear that Julia Jerry

sounds like you've got pretty chummy

where is he gone what do you mean gone I

can ask you again son I burned the page

released him on that right noble of you

proper humanitarian so let me get this

straight we take in protect you from the

thing that's on tinya spare your life

even though you're no help you give you

access to one of our most valuable

resources and you steal it from us

piss off back to England and then burn

it

just inconsiderate he asked me to oh

really you always know what evil books

tell you to do you gotta say I'm

disappointed genuinely thought you were

different but you're just another

monster no even worth the chase you want

the honors old man don't mind if I do

get away from him oh this you got

yourself a watchdog more of a lapdog

scrawny isn't she I said get back

malnourished I'd say how long since you

last tasted blood you think you can take

us both I'd enjoy it start with you old

bastard he's slower doesn't guard his

neck and you worry about him too much

don't you I go for him you get sloppy

predictable

to the quiet even so if it's having this

much of an effect I'm not going back I

can't let it in again with it what if it

kills you

always said I was dedicated to just as

easy it's not you can't think like that

John do you have any idea how much

damage you can do if you're a police

officer who wants to hurt people how

much the system will protect you I

managed to keep most of it from basura

but I wasn't you that was the hunt we

were the same you'd never known anything

different because I never wanted to all
