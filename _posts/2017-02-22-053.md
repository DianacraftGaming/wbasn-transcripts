#### GERTRUDE

are you quite recovered 

#### WALTER

yes I think so

well enough to tell my story at least

#### GERTRUDE

our good 

sergeant Walter hello 

recording

regarding a discovery made near Alexandria during operation Crusader in November of 1941 

recording date 5th of September 1997 

anytime you're ready

#### WALTER

right 

what way do you want me to start

#### GERTRUDE

well you say you were serving in North Africa when it happened 

#### WALTER

yes I was with the second Royal Gloucestershire 

whose

ours

we weren't even meant to be down in Libya originally but when the pushback against Ronald started the whole brigade was reassigned 

we were going to help with operation crusader

well that was fine by me 

my brother Frances had died at our ass when the Germans had pushed through the year before 

Ronald has been in command bled as well and I hated him for it 

I knew I'd never get to do anything about it but I always used to carry an old picture of him my clip from the newspaper 

and I made sure to keep it in my pack so I'd know him I saw him again

well just in case 

well 

there were fourvof us on the tent crew 

Frank Malloy was in command

Ralph McCulloch did the driving 

and we had a load of the name of deke 

yeah well

I'm afraid I don't remember his second name 

he wasn't with us very long

I was the gunner 

I've always had good eyes you see and you really need that for the gun 

it's all very well for Frank to point at a speck on horizon and give us the orders of fire, but I'm the one that needs to line up the shot close to a mile away and turn a Nazi tank into a smoldering brick before they can do the same to us 

I was good at it though 

I managed to get three M 1340s when the fighting started 

I would have liked it had a crack at the Panzer but it was the Italians who caught up with us at beer Elga beer 

so I never had a chance 

maybe it was just as well 

by all accounts the Germans has a lot more training so maybe it would have gone even worse for us 

but I still hated having to waste time on the Italians

a new problem 

and his Panzers are out there and a desert somewhere 

it was all a bit of a mess to be honest 

that battle

our air support 

for men to have bombed their airfields to rubble but weather had kept them grounded 

so weary hound by German planes the whole time 

the Italians had unsurprisingly taken a page out of Rommel handbook and they backed up their tanks with heavy our infantry support 

while we were left almost entirely on our own 

Frank took to the machine-gun when he could keep it pinned down 

but it was hard enough to keep our eyes on the enemy tanks without constantly having to worry about her Panzerfaust and coming out of you from nowhere 

we were still in the crusader mark ones back then so we had the speed to keep ahead of them but I was basically useless when we were driving

and in time we stopped long enough for me to get an eye on the Italian tank we ended up a sitting duck for their infantry 

all told I think taking down the three of them was a pretty good effort 

you know 

it was hot that day 

I hadn't been in the desert more than a couple of weeks by then and the sheer heat of the place was still something of a shock 

I'm from Cheltenham you see so not exactly used to the Blazing Sun of a Libyan desert 

and a crusader well for all its advantages it didn't have very much in the way of ventilation 

so we were spending a lot of time trapped in what was more or less a mobile oven 

even then I could just about stand it but once the fighting got going and the guns started firing well it was only a 2 pounder but still the heat was almost unbearable 

it was about two hours into the battle that had happened

the gun was now so hot I couldn't touch it, and I was having to wipe a steady stream of sweat from my eyes every few seconds 

the whole desert seemed to swell and swear the heat haze 

but I didn't be heard Frank caught an order to fire on the tank from the east

Ralf brought the procedure to a stop and I heard poor deke call from inside that we were clear to fire 

swearing all the time over his burnt fingers 

I could see the dark shape of an Italian guard in the distance and was trying to get the angle right but my vision was so hazy from the intense heat that it was hard to focus my binoculars properly 

then I saw it 

a flash of light, a twinkling glint of Sun from the enemy tank 

in the back of my mind I knew what it meant the Sun reflecting off their own binoculars, which are trained on us, but my head was so foggy 

but 

for all the world it seemed as though they were winking at me 

I tried to say something to the rest of the crew but my mouth was too drier and all that came out was a dull croak 

it was strange but even with the intense sunlight reflecting off that endless expanse of bright desert 

I still remember seeing the flash of their gun 

I didn't hear though 

they always say that don't they

that you never hear the shot it gets you

well I certainly didn't 

then I was on the ground with Frank and Ralph standing over me Ralph was trying to say something but I couldn't hear it over the intense ringing in my ears 

there was a smell of burning metal and below it another scent I couldn't quite place 

I tried to sit up but there was such an intense shooting pain in my left leg as I did so did I collapsed again 

a few yards away I could hear our Crusader

smoke pouring from a crack armor 

it surprised me how intact she seemed until I saw the flames creeping up from the hatch 

it was then the ringing in my ears faded enough for me to hear it 

the screaming from inside the tank 

Dickie was still in there 

I had looked at my companions and saw in their faces that they heard it too 

there was nothing they could have done for save the port full of course 

if if they had trapped him in there they've been getting to him would have been impossible and trying would only have got them killed 

so I had to lie there and listen to Dickie roast to death 

I don't know how long it took that it felt like hours 

at some point there must have been a retreat ordered as I saw the rest of the Crusaders pulling back 

Frank managed to catch the attention of one of them and the command agreeing to take me back 

some width and medics forget to look at my leg 

although there wasn't room for this all so they literally strapped me to the top of the tank and we drove off 

leaving Ralph and for to make their own way back 

it was until I tracked ralph down 

almost bought 10 years later that I found they had been captured and soon afterwards 

and spent the rest of the war in an Italian PLW camp 

or the way they described it being quite comfortable but as far as I knew at the time we were leaving them to their death 

if it had me so delirious that he'd paid I might have cried 

my memory of that trip back is fragmented and I have only faint impressions of a pain which every vibration of the tanks engines 

said from I let injured leg 

as I passed in and out of consciousness then there was stillness 

shouting I remember

a faint Frick in my arm 

and then a different sort of haze settled over my mind as numbness and sleep spread through my veins

the next thing I recall with any clarity is my hospital bed 

I've been taken over the border back to Egypt and had ended up in the British military hospital in Alexandria 

when I awoke it was so quiet that for a minute I had the sudden panic thought that I had might be deaf 

but it was just that after 70 days hearing the roar of one engine or another the Peace of an almost empty Hospital was so deep and serene that I couldn't understand it 

when she came round the nurse was kind enough to inform me that I was part of the first born Jew to have returned from Bellaire

gap year 

but they've expect him more

sure enough over the next few days the ward filled up and my piece slipped away

beneath the steady stream of injured soldiers I didn't mind too much 

as it was still a damn sight better than rolling over the boiling desert and an iron coffin 

not to mention the fact that it turned out I wasn't going to lose the leg 

which is the sort of news to put you in a very good mood 

the doctors told me I probably always have a limp as I'm sure you've noticed 

but it wasn't infected and there wasn't the nerve damage they had been afraid of so all told it was a pretty good wound to get

after a few weeks I was walking on without too much pain and the nurses advised me to start taking the occasional walk around Alexandria 

I did so 

but between the locals in the army it was a crowded noisy place

at night I took to taking my walk further and further from the hospital and the city centre and occasionally I'd find myself wondering some way beyond the city limits

Elisa's fries and egg would allow 

it was still hot even in late December but they 

on the edge of the city there was a peaceful quiet that I just couldn't find anywhere else 

it was two days before I would do to return to active duty that had happened 

I didn't Restless all week and I couldn't seem to settle down or focus on anything 

once I got out there

pumped his Billa 

crowd seemed to disperse and my mind finally cleared  a bit 

I kept walking though 

they're 

not paying any real attention to my surroundings until I found myself rather lost 

after several hours my leg was started of eight badly 

and I took a moment or two to rest against a nearby door 

the wood of the door was old and dry and creat 

as I put my weight against it I didn't even notice it buckling till it was too late 

the next thing I knew I was lying face down the dingy basement my leg screaming in fresh pain 

it wasn't broken again, which was a relief but I still had to sit there for a while recovering from my fall 

and nobody seemed to have noticed what had happened, or at least I didn't care 

and I took a few moments to look exactly where I was

the basement looked old really old 

I'm not an expert on Egyptian architecture, but it didn't look much like the rest of

exams 

more than that, aside from the now-broken door, there didn't seem to be any answers of the place 

or anything connecting it to the building above 

it was dry and cool, and there didn't seem to be anything else of note, except for an old grate made of brass or maybe bronze that I assumed led to the city's sewer system 

it was as I finally painfully dragging myself to my feet that I saw it 

from somewhere far beyond the grate as the Setting Sun fell on it came the glint of something around and white 

it was only for a second 

and I hadn't spent so long training spot objects that distance I probably wouldn't have noted it 

but there was

definitely something there 

I approached the metal grate expecting to smell the shore beyond but instead they came the scent of something else 

all that at that point I had no idea what it was but I would have described it 

there's not unlike wood 

I tested the grate and found it came away easily from the floor, leaving a hole large enough to climb through without any problems 

I had taken to keeping a torch on me on my walks, as I some times has had a tendency to wander too far, and so I'd be walking back in the dark. 

shining it into the now open hole revealed what looks like should be an old tunnel. whether it was man-made and naturally-occurring cave or somewhere in between I couldn't say 

that it was easily big enough for me to walk down 

and once again I saw that Clint of pale white a long way down

so I went in

it was slow going as my leg was still a week and the floor of the tunnel does not level 

I had to crouch at points and place my hands upon the dusty walls her support 

after a few minutes I was deep enough that my torch was the only source of light and the passage began to open up into what seemed to be a large room

it was there in a small alcove carved into the wall that I saw what I caught the light 

it was an old papyrus scroll lying amongst the shattered remnants of

this case 

I cast my torch around and saw more shells carved into the walls of the chamber 

each of which housed the scroll of its own 

they were written in the language I didn't recognize 

but they were old and they smelt of aged and dry decayed 

it wasn't the only room like that 

there were dozens of chambers like it 

all the different shapes and sizes connected like a Wharram 

some were empty

a blur still had a handful of old scrolls left in alcoves or forward to the floor 

it looked like the place had been looted long long long time ago 

after checking through few rooms I was sure that whatever this was it must have been a huge archeological find

I really didn't know who to tell about it but I knew I needed to tell somebody

as I turned to head back towards the entrance my torch beam fell upon something dark in an adjoining room 

it was a body 

from the looks of it the corpse have endured a long long time and the dry air had almost mummified it

leaving a desiccated skin stretched tight over the bony frame 

it wore what looked to be the remains of chainmail and a black Karloff Tabard with a pointed white cross emblazed on the chest 

a broken sword lay nearby now rusted almost into nothing 

and as I gazed at the dead man's face I couldn't stop a chill running down my spine 

I tried to tell myself that it was just the way the skull had walked over the years that made him look like he was screaming 

his eyes were gone but rather than simply decaying into nothingness they were ragged scratches around the edge of the socket leaving messy hollow pits 

I was feeling very afraid now and had just turned around to leave were my torch at Buckley turned off 

it was the strangest thing 

it should have been pitch dark 

there was no light that all filtering through into those underground caverns 

but it still I could see everything 

every detail of the shredded cork before me was as clear as day 

there was no light to see it 

I can't explain it even really describe how it felt 

but it was absolute darkness and I could still see 

at the same time I suddenly got the most intense feeling of being watched 

like a thousand eyes turned to me at once

I froze 

from somewhere deeper within that strange ancient library there was a sound of movement

the rustling of cloth, slow rhythmic step coming toward me, 

which darted it back away towards the tunnel that had brought me there but it was hard 

the sense of being watch was getting stronger, an almost physical weight that seemed to drag me down 

I reached the mouth of the tunnel just as a figure came into view

anymore what looked like the remains of an ancient robe and in the darkness I could see long spindly finger stretching probing toward me 

with in his shoes flowing hood I could see nothing except a single little acai 

I don't know at what point I started screaming but I know I didn't stop until I was restrained by military police 

and fleeing through the streets of Alexandra in the early hours of the morning I spend another month for undergoing psychiatric evaluation before being discharged 

#### GERTRUDE

I see 

did you ever locate that basement again 

#### WALTER

well I wanted to but I was supervised the rest of my time in Alexandria 

#### GERTRUDE

did you tell any of your superiors about it 

#### WALTER

no I was half convinced I'd made the whole thing up

#### GERTRUDE

and did you replace the grate 

the one 

that bronze grater over the entrance to the archive 

did you replace it when you fled 

#### WALTER

oh yeah yes yes I think I did 

hey

#### GERTRUDE

one other thing that feeling of being watched have you ever had it since 

#### WALTER

well I wasn't sure what to say anything but yes 

I have just now 

that funny turn I took on the way down the stairs 

I felt it again

all those eyes watching me 

#### GERTRUDE

Thank You Walter 

now I I need to check some maps with you, but I don't think we need that on tape 

are you all right here for now

or should be 

it's unlikely to happen, but 

if anyone else comes down here 

#### WALTER

I'll tell them I'm an old friend of yours paying you a visit

#### GERTRUDE

thank you 

this statement is off the record and I don't want anyone to bother you about it further

let's keep it between us 

------

#### GERTRUDE

well that was certainly useful

it's taken a long time to track down someone still living who found the Serapeum of Alexandria 

it's not a full confirmation of my theory about ancient iterations of the archive, but I'm certainly feeling validated for pursuing it.

I had been working on the assumption that the great library itself would have fulfilled the function, but it makes a lot more sense that it would have been the Serapeum  offshoot 

the ruins of the main Serapeum  itself near Pompey's pillar are quite well researched, so this could be the secret caves mentioned in certain accounts of its destruction 

according to your Napier's the destruction of the Serapeum in 391 ad was conducted by a christian mob emboldened by the reforms of pope Theodosius the first 

attempting to drive the worship of other gods from alexandria 

there are other accounts however that claimed the scholars barricaded themselves inside with prisoners and retreated to hidden caverns deep below 

some even go so far as to claim the captives were tortured into the worship of pagan deities or offered as blood sacrifices 

there's even one unnamed contemporary historian that describes the moor by tacking the Serapeum not as Christians 

but using a phrase which roughly translates as those who sing the night 

the corpse found by mr. Heller would seem to be the remains of a hospitaller knight of the order of st. John 

at least based on his description of the Tabard 

most slightly from the sack of Alexandria in 1365 by Peter the first 

of Cyprus 

while generally grouped in with the rest of the Crusades it's generally considered to be one of the few such attacks with no religious motivation 

given this discovery however I do wonder if there might have been other reasons 

regardless I have further follow-up of my own to do

my biggest concern right now is whatever creature mr. Heller encountered down there 

it was 56 years ago, but if it's still alive, I should be careful

what was it guardian of some sort 

or perhaps 

perhaps 

it too was once an archivist 

------

well only two tapes so far and already 

are 

I don't know what to think

another archive, an earlier version 

am I just part of a chain, a long, unending string of people who call themselves the archivist stretching back to 

are we all destined to end up like Gertrude, just following the same path 

I need to find out more about her

one thing's becoming clear, though. she did not trust the Magnus Institute.

something that 

I 

concerns 

the cafe 

did you want a sandwich 

that depends are you are you going to keep hovering around me

if I go to the canteen 

I just worry 

you needed five stitches after you accidentally stabbed yourself with the bread knife 

if you're still claiming that's what happened 

I am 

then you'll forgive me for worrying when you use sharp knives 

I'm 

I'll come with just give me a second to grab my coat 

sure

mr. Heller died from a stroke in 2004, making follow up on this tape difficult.

but I've found a news article from March 1998, six months after the statement was taken. it reports an explosion in Alexandria which destroyed several buildings in the vicinity of Pompey's pillar and killed 17 people. 

official investigation determined it to be a gas mains explosion but I wonder.

Gertrude Robinson is not who I thought she was.

End supplement.
