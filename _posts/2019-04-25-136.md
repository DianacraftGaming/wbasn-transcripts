I was just going to record a statement 

why 

well Daisy's been 

I've been keeping her company while while Basira is busy 

she 

oh 

I know 

well 

I've kind of got to 

I've got somewhere to be

do you mind if if she hangs around with

I I suppose 

not at all

she's very welcome 

great 

it was all my masking 

where are you off to 

therapy

oh no God Melanie I I'm sorry 

I didn't mean to

I would probably have told you eventually anyway 

even so I shouldn't have 

just forget it

it's good though

I'm glad you're getting help 

yes well

we'll see 

there's a lot of crap therapists out there 

I guess let's do it

it is a good step I suppose you got to

tell them the truth I don't know it's

all a bits you know can we drop it

of course yeah he's he's fine with it so

alright yeah are you okay yeah right

anyway I'm I'm running late so uh thank

you

anytime you alright

ask me that already right sorry I didn't

ask her to do that it's fine you're not

babysitting me alright and uh that's

what the others think sometimes but

that's not it I just don't like being on

my own if I can help it you know

flashbacks panic attacks the usual

just trying to avoid it if I can I do

it's hard yeah well don't let me get in

your way

of course statement of Alison kilala

regarding her time as friend and care at

a special effects artist Neil Liguori Oh

original statement given first December

2012 audio recording by Jonathan Sims

the archivist statement begins

I loved Neil I might even have been in

love with him it's hard to say when

there are so many emotions caught up in

a single person when they're such a

significant force in your life it gets

difficult to say what's really there at

the heart of it his work his art defined

my early life as his friendship to find

the last 20 years of it one of my

earliest memories is cowering behind my

mother watching labyrinth of the

Minotaur on our tiny television seeing

the clay of the creature move and come

alive in stop-motion it terrified me it

thrilled me it's a moment that's never

completely left me I've always had two

passions engineering and special effects

so naturally the course of my life

gradually led me towards working on

animatronics I don't care about the

other stuff not really the squibs are

squid but no matter how much you dress

it up and makeup never really wowed me

even pyrotechnics while impressive and

visually spectacular they just didn't

give me the same sharp joy as making

something that could move that came

alive directed and controlled by my hand

I always felt Frankenstein should have

been an engineer not a medical student

as reading that book I couldn't help but

see myself in that obsession but I

suppose everyone's already done the

monster as a robot haven't they and none

made it move as well as Neil did in 1975

when he worked on agents of Orion that

was one of his movies that I went back

to time and again the way the robot

moved the weight and life he managed to

give each Clank

hissing step I was 14 when I managed to

hunt down a copy home Betamax and I just

watched that scene over and over again

I was already obsessed with Neal's work

by then mostly his sci-fi stuff from the

late 70s beyond time under new york for

crawling ones all that sort of thing his

earlier stuff I certainly enjoyed but

for all my fondness for that animated

Minotaur his stop-motion work never

really grabbed me like his animatronics

the way Neil tells it he split from his

partner Gabe in 1972 and sculpting first

stop-motion had never really had the

same charm after that besides he always

told me I'm a puppeteer at heart and

that was certainly true Neal never

really talked about his early life but

sometimes when the medication was

kicking in he would tell me about his

training with puppets I could never

figure out what performance school he

learned at or even if he went to one at

all but he would twist his fingers into

all sorts of bizarre intricate shapes so

I could see the strings flowing over

them

we made them dance he would say wonder

and nostalgia in his voice oh how we

made them dance

growing up an 80s cinephile and devotee

of his art I obviously had to learn to

love horror it wasn't just his work with

John Carpenter either it was common

knowledge that Neal was deliberately

seeking out darker and more grotesque

works though no one knew why dead sky

the nightmare children Forty Winks they

were all in this period of his career

which culminated of course with toy shop

while it's now regarded as a cult

classic I still remember the editorials

at the time condemning it and some even

called it at the end of Neal Liguori oh

I think it was too late to officially be

a video nasty but it was certainly

referred to as such in the UK press he

told me later that he just needed to get

it out of his system so I don't know if

I entirely believed him

whatever the case my own relationship

with him started in 1992 on the set of

jewel of the Amazon

mid budget effects driven kevin costner

vehicle I've been working in the

industry only a couple of years by that

point and while I'd always dreamed of

working with Neil Liguori Oh someday he

wasn't quite how I always pictured it

the production was rushed the budget was

stretched the direction was uninspired

and Neil seemed broadly miserable

despite this or maybe because of it we

became friends I think we bonded on that

shoot sheltering from the rain for hours

at a time watching a soggy animatronic

Jaguar gradually start to rust I had to

fight every instinct inside me

everything that wanted to burst out in

admiration for his work and his profound

effect on my life but instead I chained

smoked and laughed trying my best to

come across as my heroes peer what was

Neil Liguria like question is harder to

answer than I always thought it would be

in so many ways he was his work

conversations were usually about the

current shoot future projects or the

most recent films of anyone he

considered worth his attention he had no

time for whatever the issue of the day

was and despised Hollywood gossip and

anyone who dealt in it I will say that

there was no warmth to him at all he was

not unpleasant or cruel but beyond that

you may as well have been talking to one

of his steel and hydraulic creations

there were two sorts of people in the

world as far as Neil saw it those who

were worth his time and those who were

not if you were in the latter group he

honestly couldn't care if you lived or

died not that most people could tell

which side of the line they fell on

there are even days that I wasn't sure

myself sometimes I remember he would

invite people over to his studio that I

was sure he hated for screenings of his

original cuts I was quite jealous of

this at the time as I'd never got such

an invitation but it was probably for

the best I didn't realize it back then

but those guests

they never quite looked the same

afterwards we stayed in touch over the

next few years even works together on

the wire runner his one underwhelming

foray into CGI he even kept in contact

when I left to have my baby it wasn't

planned but while I may not have had

much time for makeup and monster suits

the bodies inside of them were a

different matter

anyway even once I sorted out childcare

arrangements I found myself more and

more unwelcome in the industry it wasn't

the people weren't willing to hire me by

this point I had a hell of a

special-effects resume but the hours you

were expected to be working the way

suits were set up the culture of

drinking networking none of it was

really possible alongside parenting I

only really heard about Neil's work from

what he told me his disappointment at

the directors limited vision for the

irradiated creatures in Eagle falls or

his satisfaction with his latest and as

it turned out last foray into horror

with the harvest men he'd always had a

fondness for spiders he told me and I of

course reminded him that harvest men

weren't technically spiders it was

around that time that he started to

suffer his first symptoms he told me

later his greatest regret was not being

able to finish his final film an

arthouse piece simply titled dancer he

never explained what it was about nor do

I think it actually came out in the end

by the time it was due to start shooting

he'd already begun to seize up I became

his carer a few months later he just

seemed to make sense a frugal life

lucrative career and prickly personality

had left him with lots of money but no

real support while my life had left me

in a position where I cared deeply about

his well-being and was in desperate need

of money

everything just lined up so neatly I

will say this once

and you can draw whatever conclusions

you wish from it

neela goryeo did not have Parkinson's

disease he began to have difficulty

moving yes but his mind remained razor

sharp at all times and his growing

immobility at no point seemed to cause

him any pain or discomfort it was simply

that over the course of several years he

stopped being able to move under his own

power the doctors were never able to

name it anything other than Parkinson's

and I'll admit I'm no expert but I know

they were wrong when it started I was

worried that Neel would take the loss of

his work very hard it had been all he

was for so long surely being unable to

continue would devastate him instead he

threw himself into a new project one I

would never have expected but that

suited my engineering background

perfectly Neel had devised a series of

frames ropes and pulleys to be

constructed in the rooms and corridors

of his home at the end of these ropes

were hooks which slotted into harnesses

again of his own design that he wore on

his wrists his neck his torso and his

legs when properly built and attached it

allowed me to move him without a

wheelchair or my own support I could

stand him up and walk him like a puppet

I protested of course this man was my

hero

I loved him and there was no way I could

subject him to this awful indignity but

my objections were ignored as always and

Neel insisted that this was what he

wanted so I built that strange

contraption using the skills I had

developed across my whole life to fill

every corner of Neela goryeo's house

with wood and steel and cable and when

it was all done and I pulled him through

his first jerky standing motions it did

seem to make him happy

pulling on those levers and cords moving

him step-by-step limbed step through his

house it was the first time I had seen

Neil smile in years and so that became

our life

for almost a decade I went to his home

every day strapped him up and gradually

puppeted my idol through whatever

strange mimed parody of domestic life he

desired I still had to feed him had to

wash him but he would always insist his

arm be hoisted to his mouth before I fed

him a sandwich or that I correctly

positioned him in the bath and gradually

The Surreal gave way to the mundane and

it simply became our life I barely even

noticed when the harnesses were no

longer necessary when the loops for

those hooks were now embedded directly

into his body

I must have asked him about it but at

the time it just seemed like such a

natural progression it was almost six

months ago when the woman came to our

door she looked like a film student and

at first I took her for a fan Neil's

work wasn't the sort to attract adoring

masses but occasionally admirers would

find their way to his home usually he'd

send them away but sometimes he'd have

them wait in the atrium while I

positioned him in his studio ready for a

short meeting or Q&A session I was about

to ask her to wait while I checked with

him but as I started to speak she turned

her head revealing a mass of white

thread criss crossing all over the side

of their temple standing starkly against

the dark brown' of her skin she told me

to sit down and I did

I heard the levers and pulleys moved

behind me and I could tell that Neil was

being walked down the corridor towards

this woman but I couldn't see I couldn't

turn my head so I don't really know what

his reaction was

but it didn't sound like one of fear or

despair he called her Annabelle and she

sent me to his screening room she told

me I was to watch his original cuts just

until we're all done here she said and

as I walked away from Neil the last time

I saw him alive he was dancing the

cables shifting and moving him in a

graceful sweeping ballet and he was

crying with joy I don't know how long I

was watching those films they don't it

was hard to keep track of time according

to my daughter I was missing for five

months when Annabelle let me out Neal

was dead he was hanging there wrapped in

his stringless like a cocoon twisting

gently around and around and around she

told me to take the film's his original

cuts she told me to come here she told

me to give them to you

I resisted for some time I'm done now

she's 1 and I'd very much like to go

home statement ends hmm Neal Liguria you

ever see any of his work

no no really into films well let's just

say it's not a complete shock that was

something unnatural to them didn't know

he had copies in the Institute though

let alone original cuts records indicate

they ended up in artifact storage

probably best they stay there yeah yes

of course and I will cane though she

worries me I I don't know this is the

second time she's turned up peripheral

to the Institute that you know of

meaning what

she's web spider sneaky like that like

that like - you're always using where'd

you get that

mm-hmm good point we should keep our

eyes open anyway how's Becerra day I

haven't seen her much since well she

seemed a bit tense the last few times we

spoke how are you guys know the serious

she's she's been good we're together so

it's good she didn't keep treating me

like a china doll nice all right

it's understandable I suppose yeah well

what do you think you think I'm weak

just because I'm not already chasing the

next kill you think I'm less me I I

don't feel like I'm exactly in the best

place to judge the intersection between

freewill and humanity still trying to

figure that out myself John when you

went in the coffin what are you choosing

to do that did you actually think you

could save me or was that something

telling you to do it it was me I was

to a talent meant but it was my decision

it wasn't entirely about you what was it

might my memories of the coma are not

clear but I know I made a choice I made

a choice to become something else

because I was afraid to die but ever

since then I don't know if I made the

right decision I'm stronger now tougher

I can if I do die now or get sealed away

somewhere forever I don't know if that's

a bad thing and I don't want to lose

anyone else so if I can maybe stop that

happening and the only danger is to me

I'll do it in a heartbeat worst case

scenario the universe loses another

monster that's messed up

yeah I suppose it is did you know the

coffin wouldn't kill you I guess I

thought imprisonment wouldn't wouldn't

be as bad as it was and it's not easy to

make that choice than it is to actually

enjoy the result he might have noticed

when I was in there with you I I had

regrets yeah I remember

plus I thought well I didn't know what

being down they were done to you you

thought I was gonna kill you it was a

possibility guess so Daisy hmm weird

question but I haven't seen you in my

dreams the last couple of weeks

oh no I I work here now

I'm failing to protect the others so huh

right so wait did you talk to Luke broke

into Elias his old office found an

employment contract filled it in and

signed it and that worked seem so and

you're not worried about the series

trucked here

so are you I'm not going anywhere anyway

I suppose not

so no more dreams not of you and your

weird eyes just the coffin is that

better

it's mine you need to stop moping

I want you need to stop swinging around

being all sad I'm not swooning around

I'm so alone in a monster I'm alone

Martin is doing paperwork

I get dead beside he's not the only

other person here you know as me Melanie

Becerra traumatized traumatized and

paranoid because of me get over yourself

you're always talking about choices we

all made ours now I'm making a choice to

get some drinks in come in

I don't yeah okay

Melanie's out but I'll go get this here

oh she would she want to join us if she

doesn't I'll rip her throat out it's a

joke John oh yes I'll get my count right

have a seat

do you mind if I record our sessions I

do mind yes I mean it's just for my own

notes I categorically and completely do

not give consent for you to make any

recording of me ever turn it off please

I I see yes of course
