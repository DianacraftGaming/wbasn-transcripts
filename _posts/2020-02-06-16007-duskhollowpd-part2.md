[Music]

hello again it's still us I say still if

you've started listening here rather

than the last episode don't understand

so this is episode 2 of dusk hollow PD

actual play there's been a murder

surprise like an hour it's just a

massive heart attack just enormous heart

attack in the sense that something

attacked his heart in a weird way yes

definitely the housekeeper with the

poison brought you in system does

Gabriel schreiber believe that the stew

might have been poisoned no because she

did eat some and she's still fine okay

wait is she still fine yeah

for now she hasn't noticed any worrying

symptoms but we'll see how she rolls I

guess you have a few a few clues to

follow up can we introduce ourselves

oh yeah I guess Johnny rolls in any who

are you I'm actually in this system I do

basically no rolling that's fine because

I hate what I like said anyway so Lowry

who are you

hello I'm Laurie I produce the Magnus

archives and I'm playing Emma Lenski

conspiracy theorist extraordinaire

conspiracy theorist Jordan air and Frank

who are you hi I'm Frank

I have voice Becerra in the Magnus

archives and I am playing Detective

Sergeant Karl Haas Peck Alex who are you

I am Alex no live voice Martin and I'm

playing Archie Murdock who I'm rapidly

coming to realize is Martin's American

cousin he wasn't Madison even just kind

of

no wonder I hate you Sasha

I'm playing Gabrielle Schreiber who are

you oh yeah no I'm Sasha I'm still Sasha

me Sasha I play Georgie on the Magnus

archives and I'm playing Gabrielle

Schreiber skeptic again of regular

proportions and we are playing dust

collar PD a micro setting from a

government company which is myself and

sastras games company and we're using

the system the Cthulhu hack by Paul ball

darsky we did another game of yours over

on the gaming feed if you want to use

that buttons I feel the best of us is

that the end of the episode plug that we

should probably do yeah yes do every

five minutes cross-promotion another

feed there's a weird energy in this room

it's mainly coming from me so last time

you found a bode there were all sorts of

cool clues all sorts of interesting

leads well I mean I don't know about all

the rest of you but I definitely didn't

notice any clues whatsoever that's fine

well I'm covered in blood now absent

because you took a nap in the garden no

you don't sleep you can't sleep when

you're on duty all you can do is shotgun

coffee shirts that's the rules probably

I don't think we put that in there but

we didn't no one sleeps they just drink

coffee well support us on patreon read

the micro setting and find out for

yourself

so what's everyone's next move can I ask

so all the information that we gathered

you you pretty much share it unless

there's a specific thing that you're

like I'm not telling anyone else I mean

I'm not telling anyone that I pocketed

oh that is hard to say pocket did some

timetables no everywhere I think yeah

I'm assuming that you have shared the

clue of the burns timetable yes from the

wastepaper bit yes yep okay well geez I

mean I don't I don't think I shouldn't

necessarily be what with the blonde

suggesting things but I mean you know

there's a there's a match book thing for

a long drop and we could you know with

the the last pot a long drop is a

different pub in character I definitely

said the long trip

that's fair the long drop is a pump that

is up over five stories it has a central

sort of well that goes down all five of

them and no safety rails I'm thinking we

should probably check this because with

with the cigarettes and the with the

with the match books and I like your

instincts kids yes sirree

you see with the heart exploding heart

yeah that is a method they use and she

winks with both eyes okay cool so well

in ski and murdocka going after the go

to the last drop what about you guys III

don't know that it's really there's much

point investigating more at this point

it's clearly the housekeeper make the

arrest kick kick up for me are you

making the arrest no we need more

evidence I mean it's obviously the

housekeeper she found the body

no one can account for her whereabouts

she's cooked up some crock and balls

story about some perp with a scar well

that's convenient

every thick perps got a scar cuz you're

bound to never find a blonde tall thin

woman covered in blood with a scar over

one eye that's not gonna happen is it

she's just sending us on a wild goose

chase and I've spent enough at that time

on a wild goose chase before I came here

chasing geese oh it takes ages why were

you chasing geese say well criminals

started criminals too confident that is

not the job I said well sometimes the

job finds you so you guys heading back

to the police station you following up a

different leader you also know to the

last drop well I have got Angela groffle

address looks like she was in touch with

the deceased quite a lot so maybe that

she's got some evidence against the

housekeeper she might be able to tell us

more about the relationship yeah could

help us with our inquiries okay

yeah let's start with Frank and Sasha

hey that makes us the B team yeah

you piloted the police car and drive

down the address for Angela Krakow is

out in the suburbs of dusk Allah the

rain continues to beat down but when you

get out of the city it becomes less

oppressive and more just drab rows and

rows of identical houses cars that they

just make you feel kind of sad

so that's oppressive a more repressive a

little bit a little bit a little bit all

the windows curtains closed except they

twitch sometimes like someone's just

looking out staring at you as you roll

by Angela Bracco's house looks no

different to any of the others the only

difference is that it is number 15 one

before it

number 13 one after it

number 20 we're 17 or 19 who knows

rise 20 on the wrong side of the road

good questions all it's that like a gap

between the houses or does it just say

it's like semi-detached I'm gonna say

that there is one houses space there

probably should like it looks like there

should be a house but that house is gone

you need to find professor dumbledore

and he'll be able to tell you where it

is and you'll be able to gain he retired

he doesn't work for the foursome yeah

you vaguely recall one of the other

detectors being assigned to some case

out here where like a house had gone and

they vanished as well you know was a

hole I mean it would have been a big

thing but like detective Spanish a lot

you know not as much as rookies but you

know a lot so the house is very standard

home number 15 is on a plaque just

outside in the shape of an old steam

train there's the sound of shuffling

from inside and door opens an elderly

steam train well shouldn't she not

elderly but he has seizures oh you know

I should have said no she's not a

steamship she is a person she's probably

like maybe early 50s cardigan toward

oiss Kurt's well-maintained all over

yes can I can I help you mrs. grumble

yes Angela that's me yes oh what's this

about

detectives hustle back Thank You Zack

service hustle back and schreiber oh oh

goodness

can i do for you detectives well Murray

come into this yes no no please

absolutely would you like some tea some

coffee hot chocolate tall glass of water

some juice grape mango orange with

chunks don't have many Norm Chow orange

juice I'm afraid if that's that's what

you're desperately looking for anyway

come in sit down thank you

gently triathlete [ __ ] everywhere oh

goodness you hold on I'll get some more

doilies to get some more doilies and

places them down just wear whatever

you're about to touch you'll just place

down a doily so yes please take a seat

what can I do for you you were in

contacts of the mr. Jeffrey Marla Jeff

yes yes charming boy is something

happened to him he's dead Oh Oh No I've

has very difficult to hit him you might

want to up sat down for that next it's

too late for that I'm afraid sorry I was

distracted by all the doilies right

well what brings you to my door I mean

obviously I was friends with him we

communicated pretty regularly but I'm

not a suspect

I'm shocked shocked and innocent I mean

in my defense I am both shocked and

innocent just ignore the voices in your

head man no chief she volunteered that's

okay just you know because he's in her

defense strange things to say

appropriately nothing well I mean there

has been a murder you said covered in

blood did mr. marina have any enemies

that you know of not that I know of

we didn't really talk much about his

personal life what did you talk about

Oh trains mostly me did you know much

about trains detective I have been on

several it's fascinating fascinating

business steam trains especially it's

all about the power of water you see it

all used to be canals did you know that

didn't there were there were some

there's a decade when everyone was

building canals connecting the the the

industry with canals but that sort of

water slow boring useless

train the power of steam you see

detectives harnessing the power of steam

to revolutionize the world but people

have forgotten all this electricity

sorry that's a little bit of a hobby

awesome you know of course this is this

is the sort of thing that we used to

talk about by our letters myself and

Jeffrey I believe he was writing a book

on it mmm yes I did see manuscripts

could you both row me smokes actually

because we're having a we're having a

bit of a chat any chance to pick up on

any visual clues of this place as a

salmon okay yeah you're good you good

team spirit Alex no failure is the best

outcome so yes anyway I'm dreadfully

sorry going off on one of my little

rants obviously it's not particularly

relevant to your your case is not

relevant to your case is it detectives

well that's remains to be seen obviously

quickly out of character because I

forgot to make some notes

wasn't there a particular kind of train

that he was really yes the British Rail

standards be our standards and the

letter that you found from Anton the

most recent one that lowly found seemed

to it seemed like it would have

accompanied a package of some sort it

refers to here is perhaps an enormous 32

to 64 tonne package perhaps a train

package I mean probably not who's the

surface is impressive this case is

coming together it's very clear what

happened is you have a fit crime he's a

train to smuggle another train someone

posted him a whole train and he had a

heart attack from how happy he was at

being posted a train this case is

solving it so much like this chest did

you know his housekeeper she apparently

handled a lot of his post not personally

I think he made reference to her

sometimes Nelson or Nellie or Napoleon I

don't really know

remember Neal maybe and do you remember

what he said about her was it positive

negative neutral

he went into quite some detail about how

she wasn't planning to kill him at any

point in distant future how much he

trusted her with his life Amiens

yes of course well he had a very dark

sense of humor I'm sure he would

appreciate it yes of course he wouldn't

stop saying how she's dead

the deceased received a package from

yourself I believe

oh yes the the the capital a plump table

I don't really know much about them they

were me very little to do with me to be

honest i i i simply noticed them in a

curiosity shop and posted them his way

thought they might be good for his

excitement that's not what it sounded

like from the no Pleasant oh I mean I he

was I mean he was very interested in in

that sort of paraphernalia so I I simply

I simply noticed it in a shop purchased

it in that shop no reference something

that we have been looking for is

something you were both very interested

we both liked both my trains you saw my

house number it's a steam train with a

15 on it yes I noticed that I'm a

detective

yes well you know we're both very

interested in trains but I I we've been

looking for timetables and and perfectly

the that regarding some the old the

older British Rail standard trains for

sometimes I noticed it in earth would

there be a steam train so electric train

ocean train steam trains of course you

account for your whereabouts over the

last couple of days mr. gronkle yes

absolutely

she wanders over finds what looks to be

a diary and starts listing off quite a

lot of very public places there she was

well I was in the the supermarket for

about four hours not doing a murder

yesterday then I was I decided taking a

show you can see my tickets here

you know I was I was I was taking a walk

in the park at peak dog walking hours I

think I think actually yes here's a

there's the Polaroids but a dog walker

took all of you police procedural fans

this is what's called an orgy of

evidence or do you have alibis is the

it's the ticket that she tells us you

know like as far as you can tell these

alibis are all solid what did she see

sorry what show did she see Casablanca

oh the state show no it was a film but

it was in the theater they show movies

sometimes excuse me a while in ski can

you stop yes detective you your voice

changed ever so slightly there but it's

it's fine I'm sorry I obviously just

cigarettes clear up my throat you really

do need to install a fourth wall in this

building it's but yes I can probably

find you the the receipt for the the

items if you if you need it that will be

helpful thank you and I suppose you

don't mind if we have a look around no

no no please how about your husband's

hmm oh he's way away aware business has

been for several years now just one of

my little jokes he's dead a business of

decomposing there's one of my little

jacks I really want to set her up with

the doctor they would be really happy

together she will come back with a

receipt from whateleys books and curios

for one train conductors hat and one

time table brackets old yeah you can

have a look around her house and make me

a flashlight spot okay six it's a very

it's exactly the house that you would

expect this woman to have almost

suspiciously so it's almost as

suspiciously hmm exactly what this house

you would expect this window but you can

have a you can like pull out all the

books see if there's a secret passage or

like just kick up a rug looking for a

trap drawn you can't see anything shed

or anything in the garden yes she does

have a look rather shadow it's locked

miss

surname a groffle grant Gloria it's been

a long day yes look in the shed of

course

she comes over she unlocks the shed she

opens it up and it's full of gardening

tools suspiciously full you could say I

mean you could say they'll be there very

neatly organized not a spot of rust on

any of them how nice is that garden

that's nice as did you expect

yes well you know my Marvin loves his

garden and I've kept his tools pristine

in memory of him isn't that nice

I'm glad to hear you say that most of

the most of the others of the W I think

it's a little bit more because you're

both just stonewalling simultaneously

it's just the poor ones like hello and

just by staring is like I don't I feel

like I've been pressured but I haven't

been asked a question what kind of train

[Music]

like in terms of accomplishing anything

we've split the teams on the wrong axis

[Laughter]

Frank you get a ping on your pager

the station needs you to call in you

don't have no one has mobile phones in

das Hollow please have pages and they

need to go to one of the rotary phone

boxes line motion streets yeah say my

goodbyes apologize for leaving so

hastily and leaving so that's a lot of

rounds that's fine I'll just clean it

better peroxide great for getting blood

out Felix

sad should be hunting up that

information well she said she knows are

there any final questions no yes but

don't leave town oh I wouldn't dream of

it detected so meanwhile at the last

drop the last drop is a dingy

establishment still lit partially by

Gaslight it's down

some stairs from the street suicide like

them basement bars you know the cool

basement bars but also dangerous is the

long drop directly above the last track

it's it's B's it's if the building

opposite and sort of towers over head of

a turf war

I mean you joke but yes there have been

quite a few murders about it only one

drop on this tree yeah so yeah it's it's

quite late now and the place seems

pretty pretty hop in

now to be clear are we talking like

speakeasy star where you got your door

with your slider and you've got to get

in or we're talking more like a bit more

open front a bit more open front if the

door is clearly closed like it's clearly

a bar which doesn't want you coming in

okay but it's not actively trying to

stop you kid hmm before we go in

mmm-hmm hold your hand out which one

either okay hold up both okay I just

sprinkle some salt into one of your

hands I like it shouldn't do that bad

for your blood pressure

you know if I take a point of damage

notice seven should have really made you

make a constitution check but I know

you're probably predisposed no because

then I'd fail the Constitution jackets

too damaged I places yeah that's bad

good good good to know you passed the

test okay yes I then go into the inside

as you open the door

figure sort of bumps into you as walking

as that walking past on a tall thing no

bare shoulder with a skull no they're

short broad and wearing an anorak all

right then

lanes sorry

okay so I mean we asked the at the front

with the bar person and then there will

do the thing yeah trust you kid I

trusted you've got good instincts

oh geez that's a lot of pressure really

early and okay so the place goes a

little bit quiet as you start to walk in

because you're you know you need you at

least are in police uniform Alex and

there are enough people here in here or

definitely some criminals but they're

like giving you giving you evils oh yeah

you said that like metagame you said

night exactly the right time oh right

yeah

no cops Cyr I just grabbed she she grabs

you and just forcibly walked you to the

bar behind the bar is the owner of the

last drop she is like if you're looking

for some with a scar you found someone

with basically more scar than face well

let me just every like she's wearing one

of them short sleeve I was gonna say one

of them short sleeve bar shirts but is

that a thing I don't think that's a

thing I know she's wearing on them short

sleeve past bar shirts we all have a

reference for and all the like just

every bit of skin has got scars or

brulée shoes she runs a very rough pub

and cleans glasses with her like the

glass is dirty she washed it in some

dirty water she's cleaning it with a

dirty rag well what do you want cops two

strength inside you and a lot of bullets

mmm-hmm I can see scar tissues too thick

can't cut them out they're just in there

you and leave you in the back I respect

his fine thank you I haven't killed any

her to divorce you to be honest

gonna have to yeah cuz I'm rookie and

that's how I roll okay yes good feel it

outside the box the bar goes quiet and

the door opens and in walks a judge

flanked by some officials from the town

oh this is so convenient

the judge walks over he's tall he's

wearing his robes

officer Murdoch

yeah you've arrested this woman I am

trying to who put there so much going on

what are the charges

having bloody cuffs and having a scar

possession of Marlboro Reds none of

these are crimes officer no but they are

because because they're tied to the to

them to them to them to the murder so

that their crimes to that's helped is

sufficient evidence to convict of a

crime I hereby throw out this case the

case of Murray for possession of

Marlboro Reds a note will be passed to

your captain to follow up on this what

about loitering can we get around

loitering a judge is already turned to

started to walk away the officials from

the Town Hall follow behind him the door

closes and just you know life resumes in

the last drop what a nice man you would

none of that is weird to you just so you

know that is how justice works in

Tuscola when you make an arrest the

judge turns up determines whether or not

you've correctly arrested the person if

they're guilty they're taken away I mean

if not the chief shouts at you and you

just know at some point we need to have

this as a TV series and cast mind

freeman as the straight man who just

acknowledges how weird this isn't no one

else ever does so can we arrest her

again is it kind of the same rules of if

you bring fun it was a real bad idea to

antagonize your arrest the judge mm-hmm

I mean you've heard that somebody tried

once but you know they don't work for

does got a PDA and people tell like if

people are suspended or they lose their

their position in the police department

they like they tend to end up there's

like the subject of the next crime

weird or special I didn't kill him okay

and how did you know he was dead I mean

he wasn't when I got there so he wasn't

there

he wasn't dead when you got I was indeed

I was told go there I would totally be

dead already

I was told to cut the whistle I was told

to take the cat no told to return it but

when I got there he was still reading

stuff he was doing his whole dance I

don't know what the hell so I stood

there I had a smoke I waited he didn't

see me I was outside the window and then

he keeled over dead

so when he was dead like I was thought

he was gonna be I went in look this

whole job has been hell of a lot more of

a headache

then it was meant to be who gave you the

job she's starting to convulse

ever-so-slightly

oh no quickly Marie quickly foaming

isn't going to help you you know her

limbs flails knocking don't touch up

onto the table and it sort of flows

around

that's unfortunate just to the wider bar

in general does anyone know what happens

now lean over I mean usually the

ambulance comes know about half an hour

we used to just walk around until then I

mean okay can I touch no that sounds

terrible can I search the body just be

careful don't touch the froth okay

that's how you get contaminated hey it

looks like she's been poisoned hmm who

the stew I proceeded to search the now

corpse fresh cotton without touching the

skin maybe using napkins and taking far

longer than it really needs to so there

is a note with a time the time was about

10 minutes ago

and the place was the last drop there is

a matchbook for the last drop pack of

marble red cigarettes and that's about

it okay she did have a bag that the bag

is now empty right

that's not very human behavior is that

carrying an empty bag around you know

yes I can tell you know yes can we take

the body to assure the doctor that once

the ambulance like you can you can you

can call it in and doc smiley will be

there so yeah Frank are you heading to

are you are you calling in yes the

findings of the autopsy already guess

I'll come back to the coroner's office

something but Sasha you going with

hustle back are you following me I'm

following a different lead so I'm

actually gonna go and see Geoffrey

Mariners lawyer because you know in nine

cases out of ten a murders done by the

spouse in those other cases where it's

not the spouse nine times out of ten

it's a presently found the body and and

the other cases nine times out of ten

it's it's to do with the will so I'm

don't know sender that's five I'm right

everybody those are the three kinds of

murder

it's the spouse it's personally found

the body it's the person who benefits in

the world three kinds of murder so I'm

gonna go see who was named in the will

because of its housekeeper I mean case

closed

so all of the crime is no point one

percent of the time yeah okay cool

Geoffrey Mariner does not he does not

have a lawyer no he was quite young you

don't have a will yet it doesn't have a

will okay well who is this next of kin

parents his parents mmm-hmm and they're

conveniently out of the country right

that's it I'm tracking them down

in fact housekeeper will know back to it

back to Nellie shop yeah what can I do

for you alright so you mentioned the

mister Mariners parents are out of town

out down yes I think they're in Milan at

the moment okay I see and how long have

they been there I don't know a few weeks

maybe did I also live here at this

address

not often what do you mean not often I

mean they're not often it's a yes or no

question

do they live here or not sometimes

they're rich which people live all over

the place

so this is one of their legal abodes yes

okay and did Geoffrey Mariner of any

money of his own and not really just the

allowance he was given which was a lot

like he was he was I mean he was also

rich but okay

back at the police station yes doctor

doctors

Alden is there over the corpse looking

very pleased with himself which cops we

have turned guys yeah you guys can come

in he'll take one look at the body that

you guys are brought in now

poisoning something in our drink I think

hmm

yes we're probably a murder anyway this

body is fascinating is it yes so

obviously the cut marks on the chest

amateur stuff dreadfully done I mean I'm

not even sure how sharp the knife was

but strange thing is the heart

completely gone

but completely gone so neatly as if it

just stopped being there at all were

there any like whistle shaped holes in

the middle of the chest what a

fascinating question yes what there was

where the heart should be in the muscle

around it

there was a burn mark in the shape of

when it was a cylindrical shape I hadn't

really thought what it might be but now

you say a whistle yes what's just in the

shape of an old whistle and you can see

here he just wrenches up a bit of skin

and points you see these little markings

here numbers I think numbers etched into

wood whatever was within where the heart

should be burned isn't this fascinating

can we take a rubbing oh I already did

fleshy the corpse he hands you a very

like gooey piece of paper today the

numbers 9 F - 9 - 2 5 1 with my

expertise in engineering and on the

off-chance library you saw that that's

not a Jew adesso no I don't believe do

any bells

I mean you might be a trained

designation given the given while sheep

seen also buck get in here you can hear

the cheese we're using it all the way

that's nicer day mate I checked that's

your Sydney this is something you've

done rookie kind of been something I

done I'm still wearing most of the

mistakes I've made today the chief is

sitting in his office chewing a cigar if

a mountain could be really pissed off

with how your hand

in this case that is the chief his

moustache is bristling which is always

always a bad sign puzzle part what the

hell are you doing with this case I got

City Hall breathing down my neck wasting

the judges time on some trumped-up

charge about cigarettes not only that

that courts full assault back and I'm

being told of one of your detectives is

trying to hassle the Mariners rich

people rich people who are very

important in this town and are doing

their own thing and one of your

detectives is bothering them when

they're doing whatever important rich

people think that they are doing does

this sound like your case should have

been had like this why you covered in

blood you shot apart I was investigating

a murder all right I'll give you that

one I'm not happy with you hustle back

now explain what's going on with this

case this is a big case and I've got

city hall breathing down my neck can we

hear this yes I think you're in so much

trouble like when the chief is when the

chief is expressing his opinion about

the handling of a case all the crockery

and the mugs just in this it's just they

just vibrate ever so slightly why you're

gonna save yourself hustle back Jeffery

Mariner mm-hmm as you know sir he was

found dead early it's that yeah I'm

familiar with the case yeah

the throws down the case file well I'm

just reminding you of the importance of

the victim because there's just a lot of

leads to track down

okay well when's it gonna be solved I

need results also back well that's why

there's been such a mess rich man like

that makes a lot of enemies we've just

got to shake things up so really good

going to this file yeah no known enemies

it's rich everyone's his enemy everyone

wants to be rich in this town so how

close are you to solving it well I'm

looking at the coroner's report now sir

and I would say

you got 24 hours hustle back yes what I

expense it 24 hours or you're off the

case and you're off this force okay so

now get out of my office can have your

flashlights back now nice it's just the

stand of meeting with the chief yeah

yeah yeah very light pretty you know I

feel like I've had this enough to matter

massages ego of it can I choose not to

ever get my flashlights back so I don't

have to have that conversation can I

just accept being incompetent at my job
