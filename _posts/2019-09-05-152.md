August 1837 

I'll thank you again for your endeavors on my behalf Nathaniel 

I'm sure you can always rely on having a true friend in me

I've been installed here some weeks now and I'm finding myself well contented 

my sexton duties keeping my time employed such as I scarce have a chance to allow myself those dark thoughts that so concerned you when last we visited 

it's a fine little church and the Reverend is a good sort 

though I'll confess to finding his gospel readings tending towards the dull of a Sunday service 

not his fault of course 

the Lord gave him that voice for a purpose no doubt 

but sometimes that purpose does feel like it might be providing me a few minutes of unearned slumber 

still his conduct towards me has never been less than compassion itself 

why he told me not yesterday that he'd never seen the church shine like it had since I've taken over its maintenance 

shine I says

so that's a rare compliment when it comes to cleaning sandstone 

and he laughed heartily 

though the joke was of no great consequence 

so you may rest easy knowing I am happy enough 

my troubled sleep on the other hand is not of yet resolved itself in any way to my satisfaction 

I worked myself to exhaustion cleaning polishing and looking after the church proper 

and I tell you when I lie Abed I can scarce rise again for the weakness I leave myself in 

and yet sleep still eludes me

and when it does not I wake as though my heart were trying to leap from my chest

and my throat were full of dust and ashes

you need not despair Nathaniel 

I know the bottle no longer help 

and my other labels keep the nights from bothering me as once they did 

but I do find myself long for a true and proper sleep 

I tell a lie

there are some nights I find myself easily slipping to dreamless respite

though you'll think me a morbid soul for it 

those days I spent digging graves in the churchyard 

on those nights I sleep

if you'll forgive the joke 

the sleep of the Dead 

I've never quite known a rest like it 

perhaps it is the harder more physical aspect of the task 

or perhaps the quiet rhythm of it 

there's no echo as there is in the church 

just the sound of pick and shovel hitting dirt 

and when it's deep enough 

when you stand at the bottom 

the noise of the world just fades away to nothing

it is the sort of quiet that makes you feel as though the commotion and hubbub of life were but a terrible dream 

and in sleeping you were waking up to peace

you'll laugh Nathaniel 

but I almost wrote that I hope I have a chance to dig more graves 

what a thought 

no I'd not wish that 

for the dig graves one must have something to fill them 

and the good Lord takes that at his own pace 

you may satisfy yourself I am content with the position you have found for me and spare no concern for my well-being or the receipt of your charity 

your humble servant 

Hezekiah Whateley

February 1838

Nathaniel something has happened to me and I felt it only right to send a letter and let you know of it 

being as your last letter expressed such a kind curiosity towards my sleeplessness and what I mentioned to you and my earlier letters 

my nights have indeed been easier of late 

something I'm a partially ascribe to the recent outbreak of fever in the town taking more of my time for the grim business of grave digging 

and the rest to my gradual settling into my position as sexton 

there is such peace in the churchyard you see 

to walk atop the soil

that deep below my feet those blessed Souls wait happy and silent in the cool damp earth 

counting the days until the resurrection 

it gives me such warmth to think of the I have taken to spending much of my own occupy time wandering the graves 

and where the mood allows me taking my sleep there

I hope such talk does not upset you and you may rest assured I have no suicide

it is simply the serenity of the Dead 

I only 

not their lifelessness I seek 

no escape from the hardships of life for 

since you gave me this position I can call little of my life any true hardship

and I am as free of suffering as I have ever been 

but I do long for that rest 

I tell myself 

I wake each day were nude 

but I never as truly satisfied as when I'm in my slumber and insensible to the world 

perhaps that's what I hoped to find in my drinking 

gentle oblivion 

but it seems like a world ago 

I know what it truly is now 

walking the churchyard

though you may rest assured I shall wait my turn like a dutiful servant until our Lord sees fit to call me 

I do find however that when I dig my grave I have been going deeper 

and at times I worried I might dig so far as I can no longer get out with my meager ladder 

now those moments you must not cast judgment on me for this Nathaniel 

for is simply a passing fancy 

but I will often lie myself down on that soft earth 

I will sleep and I swear to you that the sleep I find there is more blissful than any I've ever found 

it was there not a week ago that it happened I was digging a grave for the Squires father 

a cruel and venal man who I rather doubt as easy found himself in the kingdom of heaven

but a pure soul is not what buys you a well-appointed cemetery plot 

and he had plenty of money to do exactly that

I saw his body you know as it was being prepared 

and I tell you truly that for all the wickedness that man had done his body knew gentle repose 

though not as gentle perhaps as it might be with six feet of Earth atop it 

so that was my task 

and sure enough I went about it with my usual fervent Duty 

such that the work of the day was done by the time the Sun were at its height 

it was cold that day and bitter windy 

and cracking the ground had been as hard as ice 

least entire a few feet down 

but by the end of it 

oh 

I tell you there was warmth in that grave

whether by my own body or the heat of the soil I couldn't say 

but it was as comfortable as the fireplace of a public house 

and the wind could not reach me in the hole that I had made 

so as Ismail a habit I lay down and I had no sooner done this than a powerful sleep overtook me 

I had a dream then 

I dreamt a rain had come 

a terrible bitter rain that chilled my bones and turned the soil around me darkened 

sodden 

the walls grew damp and slippery 

their firm shape lost as they began to slip and crumble 

and then all at once they collapsed 

the grave filling in a moment with a wave of mud and wet dirt 

a single terrible moment of utter terror 

it was a top and around me 

covering my face and filling my lungs with it's awful choking sod 

and the strangest thing was that it was wonderful 

I had never felt such safety as within the crushing weight of earth all around me the pressing embrace of the Buried

in that instant I knew what it was to be dead 

and I ached with envy for them 

when I awoke I was above ground again 

amid the graves 

the rain had been no dream 

I was cold and soaked through 

wracked with a chilly may well discern from the quality of my hand 

it was true also that the rain had caused the grave to collapse 

though I must have left it shortly before that happened 

I was in no state to address the issue however 

in fact the Reverend had to ask the sexton from some marks to do so 

as I am still laid up in bed with this cough 

perhaps I shall be joining the churchyard sooner than I dared hope 

write me back soon for I have precious little to do in this invalids bed 

and sleep is far from me

once again 

your humble servant

Hezekiah

June 1838 

I must first thank you for your visit Nathaniel 

as though my recovery were well completed it is always most heartening to see an old friend 

I hope that the business that drew your way so abruptly were well completed and that I may anticipate your company again after not too long 

I must tell you I've been in some distress these last few weeks 

do you in no small part of the agitation of the Reverend

who has of late succumbed to a very specific though understandable mania 

the circumstances and causes aren't easy enough to explain 

it was the funeral of young Nelly Cooper that did it 

which was a most upsetting affair I'll say 

I have much sympathy with his plight 

as I have a chance to view the body myself and if you'd asked me if I concurred with doctor glances 

judgments of death by drowning 

I would have agreed without hesitation 

she had that peace to her that I've spoken off to you before 

and I knew how happy she must be to soon be returning to the earth 

but that day as they carried the slim coffin down towards the hole that I had dug and so recently enjoyed my own calm repose

there was a commotion among the pallbearers 

the little Nellie's coffin began a shaking and all rocking back and forth such as they were unable to keep their footing and dropped it

the crash of the wooden casket hitting the earth is a sound I'll not forget in a hurry 

nor the shriek that came from inside the splintered wood as it burst open 

as you may well have surmised Nellie was not after all dead and had shaken off the stupor mere minutes before she was due to be placed below ground 

she's unharmed at least in body 

though I can scarce imagine the maddening strain must have put on her to see her own tombstone carved and waiting above the dark silence of our open grave

to be honest I suspect the worst effect is upon the Reverend 

to be so near responsible for burying a personal life has shaken him deep 

and he stopped all funeral services for a time 

to my mind there are far worse fates but he has in his head an idea to begin fitting the graves I dig with these new safety bells that he has heard of so that 

enya's might be alive below ground might signal us above for rescue 

I dread the idea 

if it had been me in that coffin destined for the peace below ground I can think of little that I would hate more than the jarring clanging of a bow pulling me from my rest 

my dreams have been strange of late 

yours 

Hezekiah

December 1838

I've been thinking, Nathaniel, of funerals and bodies 

souls that escape leaving this common play to become one again with a truer clay 

were we not created from mud 

and it seems more fitting to me that we should return forever to that mud 

not pulled from it by some would-be Redeemer or lifted to sing hosannas in his holy court 

I've worked so long so hard do I not deserve a rest in the mud from which I came 

commit my body to the earth and let it stay there 

I do the same for you 

for worship of the Most High 

though it may be earned perhaps by he that made the heavens and the earth 

well to my mind all that prayer still sounds a lot like work 

do you know what the Reverend said in his sermon the other day 

he said that in the kingdom to come there will be no need of sleep 

that we shall never need to miss a moment of that bliss 

but sleeping in the cool soft dirt is all the Bliss I could ever ask for

I suppose the Lord would have no call to think such things a blessing 

he was never buried was he 

not truly 

laying in a cave for three days a rock pushed across the entrance before being taken up bodily 

no he was never buried 

and he always had more work to do 

harrowing hell and redeeming the sins of mankind

now he had no rest and never asked for it 

save a moment of doubt a girth cemani

but he is the son of God and we are merely sons of the dirt 

we are not as strong as he is and we deserve rest 

we deserve to sleep

I've been trying to sleep 

but that Bell kept ringing 

the one over Jacob the baker's grave 

that nonsense safety valve the Reverend insisted on putting there

ringing and ringing and disturbing the sleep of everyone in the churchyard 

I've no doubt it disturbed Jacob as well who worked so hard all his life and never thought to complain of his lot 

he deserved to rest so I cut the cord 

and now he is quiet 

I can't get my clothes clean anymore 

my shovel is never far from my hand

yours 

Hezekiah

January 1839 

I am disappointed Nathaniel 

I'll not deny it

more than that I am hurt 

my letters to you have always been a comfort to my soul 

a place where I may lay my heart bare and till the truths of what I think and feel without fear of judgment or reproach 

that you chose to share what last I wrote you with the magistrates has wounded me 

saw they came and asked their questions as I'm sure you hoped they would 

but could of course prove nothing

Jacob is long dead and I was a very careful how I stopped the Bell 

but such suspicions eat away at peace and of course the Reverend dismissed me 

I've lost my churchyard Nathaniel and I wonder if I shall ever sleep again 

it was my own fault of course 

I should never have told you these things assuming you would understand 

but how could you 

you've never felt the closest embrace of peaceful soil 

you've never truly slept in the bosom of the earth

these things are not such as can be shared in words 

and it was my foolishness to think that they could

Pawar Enoch Nathaniel 

the love I bear you will not let me leave you ignorant as I did with the Reverend 

I will come and I will show you once and forever the true and glorious peace of the buried

your most humble servant

Hezekiah Wakeley

statement ends

Nathaniel Beale is buried on the grounds of st. Peter's Church in his hometown of Dunstable 

and I am only the third person to know that in almost 200 years 

after Nathaniel Beale himself and mr. Wakeley 

the person who buried him 

I cannot tell how much of the change that comes over someone when they are taken by one of the fears is a direct product of their influence 

and how much is their own mind desperately contorting itself to accept and justify the awful things they find themselves drawn to doing 

I have read many statements now by those who are changing 

who are becoming something else

and few if any of them seem entirely rational 

entirely the people that they were before 

how can I tell 

I suppose my job is to view people at their lowest

their most fearful and unstable moments

perhaps there is less change there than I imagined

certainly I don't feel different 

I have no desire for pseudo-religious philosophizing 

or delighting in the suffering of those I harm 

then again I suppose I'm hardly in the best position to judge

perhaps to anyone listening to these tapes I sound remarkably similar to Hezekiah 

what at 

manuela or to Jane

hello John 

been a while since you've been down here 

I didn't come here to see you

oh come now 

I'm sure a more interesting company than the late Jane Prentiss 

it's all that's left of her now apart from a jar of ashes in my desk 

just a circle of rotten stone on an otherwise unremarkable 

more the legacy than some people get 

because we had to be a gate I think 

a hole that she rotted 

the corruption itself 

may be the start of a ritual 

hmm 

not exactly impressive is it

less complex certainly 

but I think that's the thing about 

what did the last call it 

filth 

I don't think it really plans much 

it just starts to grow wherever it can get a foothold 

and if no one stamps it out in time 

game over 

how clumsy 

though I suppose it has a certain charm 

I've been wondering what they were doing down here

who else must have been down here  for weeks months maybe 

spreading growing

they could have spread all the way through these tunnels but they didn't

they didn't find Leitner out here

didn't find go throughs body 

didn't find

whatever else is here 

it is a maze 

one of the reasons I like it 

mm-hmm 

I can't see things properly here 

I thought it was just me 

something interfering with my connection to the eye 

but I'm wondering maybe it affects everything else 

like this place is some kind of universal blind spot 

everyone gets lost down here

what a fascinating idea 

although some of us are always lost in a sense 

well are you saying you can navigate it

not exactly 

but my door has been part of these tunnels for some time now 

what's it hiding 

what's in the middle 

a delightful surprise that's not why you're here

or is it 

yeah 

I've been thinking a lot about Jane 

she was the first 

the first I actually encountered like like us 

she seemed so inhuman 

like everything she used to be was stripped away 

and now I wonder how much of her was still in there 

how much did she choose to be 

what she was 

I read her statement 

she was she was scared 

I assumed she'd been possessed completely against her will

but now I'm not even sure that's possible 

it is astounding the sort of thing you're willing to choose given an unpleasant enough alternative isn't it

how much of a willpower is just safety comfort by another name 

the option to choose and be 

fine 

hungry 

oh that's not

I haven't done anything yet 

I feel like if I don't I might die fade away into nothing 

do you know that 

no 

but I can't die

they need me 

come on John 

no excuses

they didn't need your protection 

what 

are you going to look after them 

and how would I do that 

you eat things as well

they have to open the door 

our quest 

I can't just push them in 

huh 

you've got hands sharp enough to pull out one 

kill a few old man 

maybe stab an overeager outcast 

but my physicality is as much an illusion as everything else about me

think of me as a bear trap not a sword

but we're not talking about me 

are we

when does it stop 

what 

the guilt misery

all the others I've met 

they've been cold cruel 

they've enjoyed what they do

when does the 

I made me monstrous 

what would it ever do that I don't

when have you guilt through your third

nurse 

or your hand-wringing ever actually stopped you from doing what it wants 

I have not been taking statements

you've sworn of other people's drama fen nano 

because you're caught 

because continuing would endanger 

but other than that 

when has your discomfort ever actually stopped you walking the path of the beholding 

I don't know 

even if it were capable of doing so 

what possible reason would the 

I have to 

change how you feel 

when it makes no difference to your actions

Helen was like you at first 

she felt such guilt overtaking people 

until one day she realized she wasn't going to stop doing it 

so she chose to stop feeling guilty 

fine I get it 

my feelings mean nothing to it 

not true

they carry a certain flavor 

a seasoning

I see 

I am enjoying our time together

well you know my face already

cheerio John 

enjoy your brooding
