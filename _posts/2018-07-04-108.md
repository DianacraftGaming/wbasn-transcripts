Martin Blackwood archival assistant at

the Magnus Institute recording statement

number zero zero nine to zero zero eight

statement of Adonis Spiros given August

20th 2009 statement begins it's been so

hot recently that sticky sort of hot you

only really get in the city on the beach

watching the clear blue waters swell and

recede would be wonderful to simply sit

still and alone to experience it but in

the city there is no stillness no

privacy the swell is that often ranked

sweaty humanity and to press through

them is to work the dirt and dust that

infuses the air into your own skin the

stink is deeper than just a simple smell

I suppose I'm lucky that my work rarely

takes me out during the middle of the

day I am an actor by trade and both

skilled and fortunate enough to find

myself employed more often than not I'm

not sure I would say I enjoy it

necessarily but I do find a certain

fulfillment in it I remember the first

time I felt the calling I was nine years

old

visiting my grandparents in Athens and

my parents are taking me on a trip to

see the great amphitheatre

it was winter not the season for

tourists my parents were off in a corner

somewhere arguing but just for a moment

I had the place entirely to myself and I

felt it that strange centering that spot

at the core of everything where you and

you alone speak your words heard by no

one an inn that no one the entire

universe yes I am aware that normally

there is unless something has gone badly

wrong an audience or at the very least

other actors with which to trade

dialogue and that's fine but that is not

what I live for I live for the monologue

when all others

eat away and the light tightens on me

excluding all else have you ever had

stage lights in your eyes the brightness

deals everything else and if it's strong

enough you can look out into the

audience and see nothing at all just you

I am a fine actor and a very capable

physical performer but these are simply

the Jews I pay to earn my way to a

monologue for the last two weeks I have

been performing the part of Jack in as

you like it you know your Shakespeare

well it's not the greatest production of

the play which can be very funny if

daren't right

the director a man named David Austin

has neither the vision nor the spark to

turn it into something truly memorable

and the reviews reflect that I don't

care though that's not why I do it you

see there is one part of as you like it

that almost every english-speaking

person will know and that is a monologue

by Jacque all the world's a stage and

all the men and women on it merely

players they have their exits and their

entrances and one man in his time plays

many parts his acts being seven ages I

told you you know it and for all his

failings mr. David Austin made one

directorial decision for which I cannot

praise him enough during this soliloquy

he has the other actors in the scene

walk upstage beyond the lights and has

me delivering the lines out into the

audience alone for the play it's a bad

decision that scene is supposed to be

Jacques performing joking for the

amusement of the Duke and his friends so

this staging makes something that should

be light and energetic into a serious

and soulful meditation and it doesn't

work from a dramatic point of view but

for me declaiming

casting my voice out surrounded by

people watching me yet completely alone

I have rarely had a part that feeds my

soul like this one it helps that we're

performing at the Dukes Theatre in

Covent Garden it's about as traditional

a theatre as you're likely to find and

when the

shines the audience's rendered as mere

silhouettes completely anonymous

at least until four nights ago it was my

big moment act 2 scene 7 the others had

vanished the audience was gone and it

was just me at least at first I remember

it was as I began to talk about the

Justice the fifth age of man that I saw

it he was a mask a theater mask

not one of the happy sad ones you might

associate with the stage but like an old

Greek chorus mask neutral with a faint

aspect of mourning about the mouth and

eyes it sat on top of a thick black

cloak draped to completely cover whoever

might be wearing the mask but I knew it

was empty it was a hollow shape of a man

that had no life no presence to it and I

saw it in the middle of the third row as

clearly as if it were lit by a second

spotlight I stumbled of course I stumble

I don't believe anyone in the actual

audience really noticed though the other

actors offered their faux sympathies

over it afterwards I did make it to the

end and pushed on through the rest of

the performance but the mask did not

disappear and watching the other actors

quickly convinced me that either they

did not notice the thing in the third

row or they simply could not see it

oddly I've never feared for my sanity

I've always been superstitious and I had

no doubt that what I had seen was some

sort of Specter or omen of what however

I had absolutely no idea to be perfectly

honest I still don't this is one of the

reasons I am here because I have this

deep and gnawing fear that it portends

nothing but itself and within that there

is some strangely awful fate waiting for

me I have never been quite as social as

I am told an actor should be rehearsals

have always been a professional thing

for me and I've rarely resulted in

friendships and I actively avoid after

show drinks

it will perhaps not surprise you to

discover I instead prefer to walk the

city to find those streets and places

where the night crowd does not gather

and wander those empty lights clearing

my head as I leave the heat and cloying

conversation behind in the summer months

this ritual is almost the necessity for

me to remain stable my steps taking me

through the echoing streets and

artificial lights an edifice to humanity

uncluttered by the messy existence of

actual people the mask and cloak did not

appear at the theater the following

night I looked for it yet saw nothing

but an audience of silhouettes quiet and

intent safer when applause was required

it wasn't my best performance on edge as

I was but I got through it afterward

Patrick Dunlevy who played Orlando who

was more insistent than usual that I

joined them for drinks after the show

and it took all my composure to keep my

excuses polite as the sticky heat of his

presence pressed through over the fading

warmth of the stage lights and the high

summer that pervaded even the Duke of

York but I did escape him and fled into

the cooling dampness of the city streets

by night streets which I knew were less

likely to be populated were mercifully

deserted and the windows of the

buildings either side were lit but empty

of anybody visible my breathing began to

slow my steps became more sure and the

oppressive thickness of the air lessened

just enough for me to relax

I began to look up at all the darkened

windows above street level

it's a strange truth to realize that for

all the throng of humanity that exists

in central London almost nobody actually

lives there all the apartments and

residences that sit above the bustling

shop fronts and businesses are almost

all empty

Baltar's investments by the financiers

and oligarchs who have no desire or need

to live in them if you raise your eyes

upwards in central London and count the

lid windows it's not at all unusual to

see none at all but that

as I caught my breath and raised my head

there was a lit window on the second

floor and within it a masked mockery of

a human figure my face fell until I had

the odd certainty that my expression

matched that of my pursuer and panic

began to settle over my brain pinprick

crawling from the back inch by inch over

my skull and I knew that when it reached

my eyes I would run the figure didn't

move of course it didn't there was

nothing to it that could move no will

that could make it follow me and yet it

still watched it's hollow empty eyes

drawing me into it I ran for some time

through streets I knew should be humming

with drunks and Nighthawks and

insomniacs but they were all silent I

was alone

sometimes when I turned a corner at the

far end I could see it waiting for me

and I would turn away sometimes when I

looked over my shoulder I would see it

there following me with its stillness

its absence once I looked up and the

windows were full of it

I don't know how long I ran but in the

end I fell physically spent and sunken

in despair raising my head I saw it

before me waiting so I stood and began

to walk slowly towards it it gave no

reaction simply waiting my arrival as I

got closer I saw it more clearly the

heavy weave of the black woolen cloak

The Shining porcelain of the mask the

hollow empty space behind the eyes

inside the mouth I faced my demon and

there was nothing there in a fit of

sudden rage I struck out my arm catching

it on the side of what should have been

a head but the cloth crumpled beneath my

blow the mask fell and the figure

collapsed into a heap inside was a

simple wooden stick once propping the

thing up but now fallen to the ground

lying motionless I went home quickly my

eyes downcast and furtive and went to

bed I only once looked out of my window

at the street below I don't think it's

going to stop last night was the worst

yet I knew they were coming but how do

you prepare for something like that the

first was there in the audience before I

even set foot on the stage by my second

entrance there were five that I could

count and when I began my monologue the

whole auditorium was full of masks all

the world's a stage and it was empty my

only company the mocking grotesques of

pantomimed humanity the mewling infant

the schoolboy the lover the soldier the

judge each eliciting such a roar of

nothing from them it took my breath away

perhaps I should have stopped fled the

stage quit acting entirely but it was

like a lonely avalanche and it flowed

out of me in a wave and I reached

oblivion an absence of applause that

nearly deafened me

false everything after the show David

came up to me he wore his best directors

smile and made as to shake my hand his

mouth moved telling me how much this

performance had meant to him how right

the energy had been and how whatever I

had tapped into within myself I should

reach for it again at the next

performance I tried to listen to naught

but his eyes were hollow and I knew that

he wasn't really there I have another

performance tonight in less than four

hours I will be on that stage again

speaking those empty lines to emptier

ears I could run of course but I won't

where would I run to all the world's a

stage and I can't escape my monologue

statement ends um not sure there is

anything to say about this one John's

God is looking into anything that might

involve theatres or the circus but to be

honest I don't think this is really what

he's looking for the strangers here seem

different I guess and he doesn't have

any clowns or dancing or skin I wanted

to ask Tim about it but he hasn't been

around much the last week or so says

he's working on something which is I

mean it could be fine

I guess he's just quite intense at the

moment he scares me sometimes

truth be told none of us are doing great

but it's actually Melanie who seems I

don't know something's happened I think

had works been kind of off lately and

any time I talk to us he just finds some

reason to leave I asked her to look into

what happened - Adonis B Ross the actor

from the statement and she hasn't

bothered as far as I can tell John

called he's in America now wanted her to

help with something but

I had to make an excuse for her he he

doesn't need that kind of thing on his

mind right now I just hope he gets back

soon you know saying it out loud I think

I'm actually really worried about

Melanie I you know what

basura knows about than I do I've been

to all quite a task but I need to I

really think I need

the serie Melanie to him

Martin isn't it don't move and don't you

come any closer

okay I've got it I've got a knife didn't

I that would seem wildly out of

character from what I've been told

okay but okay stay back please Martin

I'm not gonna hurt you

I just thought we might have a chat

alone oh you're one of them aren't you

heard a Lucas

yes that's Peter pleased to meet you now

how did you know that I was just reading

John left some notes and I see I'm sorry

to have disturbed you it's one of the

wisest little jokes I did what did he

suggest you record a statement today one

that mentioned me yeah sort of I mean

you know not used specifically but I

have a meeting with him today he

suggested I'm sure he's watching from

his office grinning from ear to ear

I don't I almost thought he genuinely

wanted me to meet the team

oh well I'm really sorry I I don't

actually do way to go you Martin yes hmm

probably for the best

and what's a lawyers like to work for

aside from orchestrating unsettling

encounters that's that's a lot of it to

be honest and that's not something you

look for in an employer I assume well

he's I mean you just you've just said

he's watching us almost certainly how is

he as a boss fine I guess I mean not so

much with the manipulation and sometimes

murder

oh that doesn't sound what the Elias I

know he killed people himself I mean I

wasn't I wasn't there but that's what he

said and I didn't see the body bodies

Elias Bouchard getting his hands dirty

oh well

must be the end times don't so your

advice would be less murder

I suppose no no it's a good observation

I thank you for it you're welcome well

I'm sure I've disturbed you quite enough

for one day Martin I have a meeting to

get to and a few things to tell Elias to

his face about wasting both our time be

seeing you

as it were yeah by what did you call me

yeah um did you see anyone when albear

just now um no no no I figures so did

you need anything

does the name Peter Lukas mean anything

to you oh yes actually I've been reading

a bunch of all statements he's that

croupier boat captain right from the

family Elias doesn't want us bothering

yeah well apparently and that warning

doesn't go both ways he was here yeah I

I mean I think I think so was he whoo I

mean a bit yeah oh oh dear maybe I don't

know honestly he was just a bit we eat

yeah is that why you wanted me oh no

like you busy a bit I was reading

through a bunch of stuff about the

church with a divine host did you look

into that statement about the chaplain

hit the green because apparently you're

right around that time there was a full

solar eclipse going on in guess where I

don't near alicent and when Natalie

Ennis talked about it being 300 years

ago well how much do you know about the

relationship between Edmund Halley and

John Flamsteed would he like the comment

exactly look Pacific that's really

interesting but that's not why you're

close to Melanie right I guess so closer

than anyone here I think she she doing

okay why did she say something no no

it's just her works been look she's

always been quite you know conscientious

but then recently okay look I don't know

what the situation is she won't Tommy

but she's not doing well we were meant

to go for a drink last week but I think

it has something to do Elias Elias Oh

God yeah

oh well maybe we can what oh right
