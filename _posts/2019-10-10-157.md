they'll be coming back you're not going

to die if that's what you're asking but

no if all goes well you won't be how

does that make you feel nothing nothing

at all

excellent I'm so proud of you Martin I

really don't care

perfect this tape was left on my desk I

don't know by who but to my mind there

are three options

Martin has left it here to let me know

that whatever the situation is with

Peter Lucas it is entering his final act

and he needs my help

alternatively Peter may have left here

to goad me into action or just to gloat

to highlight my helplessness at

everything or Annabel Kane is trying to

manipulate me into thinking it's one of

the other scenarios previously the

spiders have made their presence clear

when they've sent me hints but I can't

take that for granted I don't know what

to do there's a statement with it

it looks pretty recent first time in a

while I've been wary of reading one

still I guess

statement of a de la Decker regarding a

potential pandemic originating in the

town of clunks pool Germany original

statement given 14th August 2013 audio

recording by jonathan sims the archivist

statement begins you must forgive me

gertrude for any typing and spelling

errors that might be in this message my

hands are shaking quite badly and my

fingers aren't what they were you can so

just knowing where this is going this

statement I can feel the eyes power on

me be it ever so slight steadying me

helping the words flow is it strange

that here now that seems almost a

comfort this is the last time you will

hear from me you must trust me on that

and not come looking

not that you would I know you're too

smart for sentimentality

especially after what I have to tell you

but I feel it worth saying nonetheless

perhaps I'm simply prevaricate trying to

cling on to a few more precious minutes

of life but that's not me I know what

awaits me and I must have no hesitation

in going to my reward I know you've

never had much patience for my faith but

perhaps it will provide you some small

peace knowing I faced my death gladly

knowing I have done my duty before God I

have spoken to you before of Christabel

my contact within the ECDC she had a

run-in with the crawling rock some

decades ago and has since then kept me

up to date with any incidents they have

encountered which display unusual

properties well she alerted me to what

was internally believed to be a

potential pandemic originating in the

small town of clunks pool on the German

Danish border

from what I understand it was a

perfectly Pleasant small town remarkable

mainly for a rail line running out to a

large island off the mainland but as it

was it had been completely quarantined

Christabel reported that the disease

seemed to be artificial or man-made in

origin and her colleagues were keen to

label it as a bio weapon but its

behavior didn't follow any normal

patterns or vectors combined with its

extremely disturbing symptoms which

caused the skin and muscles to become

loose and malleable until they soft

completely off the body leaving only a

skeleton and organs well she was certain

that it was the product of of a worldly

evil and called me I've spoken before

about how keenly I've watched news of

possible pandemics which is where I

suspect the extinction may pull away

from the corruption during its emergence

this alongside the possibility of the

disease being man-made though I am

certain no human had anything to do with

it well it was more than enough to draw

me in I had no interest in compromising

christabel's position so I made my own

preparations for entry borrowing a

hazmat suit from one of the tents

erected around the perimeter I always

despised trying to move in those things

but it seems they've made some real

improvements in them over the last 15

years so I was able to stay relatively

quiet as I talked in my way past the

cordon and headed into infected Punk's

pool

I'm certainly glad this happened south

of the border with Denmark as my German

is passable compared to my non-existent

Danish once inside the town it became

rapidly apparent how bad the situation

truly was you and I Gertrude have seen

more visions of Hell than anyone has a

right to while living but this was

something else entirely

thin trails of blood and skin crisscross

to the streets the walls and windows of

nearby buildings were coated in a fine

sheen of discarded gore it didn't take

me long to find my first victim wrapped

around a lamppost he had clearly tried

to lean on it for support in his

distress but his flesh had begun to

spread and fuse over it in thick ropey

tendrils his bones were almost bare to

the elements but it was then that I saw

the thing that to my mind is perhaps the

worst of it his heart was exposed it was

beating fast so fast despite the awful

green decay that seemed to be eating at

it I knew at that moment there was

nothing that could be done to save the

town but I could perhaps identify the

cause and identify it I did I began by

checking houses looking for anything

that might have been an unusual artifact

or one of those dreadful books few doors

were locked and many seemed to be

swinging open in the breeze that I was

deeply thankful I could not smell still

for all the quaint home was with their

slanted roofs that I combed through I

found nothing that might qualify as an

origin for the small towns gruesome

demise

but neither did I find many other

victims there were a few a woman melted

into her now crimson bed an old man

whose bright eyes still stared out of

his skull watching the television though

the rest of him lay pulled on the floor

and in all of them the frantic beating

of their decomposing hearts the state of

these homes however was seem to indicate

that many had begun to develop symptoms

while still inside countertops in

otherwise empty houses will be coated

with blood wooden floorboards peppered

with flecks of gristle yet of these

individuals there seemed to be no

obvious sign except a line of viscera

leading towards the front door it was

then I realized that I had been

following the trails entirely the wrong

way they were not people returning home

to die the sick were pulling themselves

out of their houses crawling dragging

themselves towards some other place

leaving bits behind on the rough

pavement as they did so so I began to

walk slowly both because of my bulky

suit and the rising sense of dread in my

stomach

I wondered Gertrude whether you are

truly as fearless as you seem or if you

are simply a master of disguising your

terror I suppose I'll never have a

chance to find out I rather hope it was

the former however much I disagree with

some of your methods it feels good to

believe there are people in this world

who can stare down the devil without

flinching

I found the source of this sickness in

the park plants opposite the train

station the cars had been pushed to the

side clearly at great cost to the bodies

of those that pushed them and in the

center was a figure from whom the rot

clearly flowed he was sat upon a most

dreadful throne formed from a dozen two

dozen bodies mixed together like putty

eyes staring out like horror stricken

stars twinkling in the night and their

hearts beating for all to see a moaning

came from that awful seat voices trying

to scream through things that weren't

their throat and it is a sound I shall

be glad to leave behind me when I go to

my rest I will confess to being

perversely disappointed when I saw the

figure sat upon it no pale Spectre in a

lab coat or twisted golem of petri

dishes and test tubes now he was lanky

wearing an ill-fitting brown suit and a

smile

I'd never previously had the misfortune

to meet him but I knew the description

well enough to recognize John Amherst so

it seemed it was not the extinction as I

had anticipated but simply a new and

awful strain of corruption still it was

not something I felt I could leave to

run its course unopposed at first I was

struck almost with despair having

nothing to hand with which I might

attempt a confrontation with this

creature but upon retreat in some ways

and considering my options I realized I

actually had almost the exact resources

to hand that I might need a few minutes

spent scouting the surrounding streets

even revealed a small construction site

almost precisely suited to my

requirements

I returned to the cordon and took what I

needed a stretcher as many quarantine

sleeves as I could carry

and a syringe the medical staff appeared

to have retreated to the large tent that

served as their base of operations and

if anyone noticed me they didn't

interfere I loaded the gear into a

wheelbarrow I had taken from the

building site along with a thick metal

chain and began to head back towards the

park plants stopping only to fill the

syringe from a can of garden pesticide I

had noticed during my earlier sweep of

the houses finally I revealed myself he

approached me coyly clearly believing me

to be a foolish or lost ECDC medic

perhaps he assumed I was frozen in

terror at the sight of his work and

luckily my has mat-su did much to hide

my expression he walked up to me with a

smile so wide it tore the edges of his

mouth leaking a sick green liquid from

the edges reached a hand out for my mass

it was then I gripped his hand and

plunged the syringe and his spongy flesh

and pumped him full of the chemical

cocktail he staggered back ripping the

needle from my hand and fell to the

floor shaking I had no illusions of

poison being sufficient to destroy an

avatar of Filth though from what I knew

of his affinity to insects I hope it

would be at least temporarily effective

regardless I had to work fast I dragged

him to the stretch run strapped him down

wrestling against his thrashing spasms

even through the hazmat suit I could

feel the diseased heat of his skin I

wrapped him round with the chain which

would I hoped hold him fast as I pulled

the plastic over the stretcher in layer

after layer until I could barely see him

through the thick clouded material I

hadn't brought any of the supports with

me so in the end it looked less like the

well-constructed

tube of a quarantine stretcher and more

like a lumpy vinyl sack

still it was sealed and that was enough

for my purposes I dragged the thing over

to the building site with the last of my

strength threw him into the hole that

had been left by this point of concrete

truck I'd turned on earlier had been

mixing for some time and it was a simple

matter to open the pump and pour the

contents of its hopper down on top of

him how much he had recovered by this

time I couldn't say for sure but he

certainly moved around plenty as that

thick gray sludge began to cover him I

can't deny some pride in my solution

Gertrude in all our discussions of how

to contain a being that we could not

destroy I'm not sure we have a hit on a

method quite so neat I am a builder but

by the end I think you would have been

hard-pressed to criticize how well that

concrete had been laid an amherst for

feet beneath it and now the part of my

tale you must have anticipated from the

beginning during the altercation the

adrenaline had kept me from noticing the

tear that Amherst had made in my hazmat

suit while I wrestled him onto the

stretcher but as I sat to savor my

victory it became clear that a great cut

on my leg had gone clean through the

material there was no way that I was not

infected and indeed over these last few

hours I have felt the sickness working

on me my pace is sluggish and I can feel

my skin begin to loosen my heart is

beating so fast it shakes my whole body

but I shall not wait for it to putrefy

as the rot overtakes me I have dragged

those other afflicted I could find into

the park Platts laid them at the feet of

that appalling thrown

taking the last gifts of that generous

construction site a dozen cans of petrol

I will sit upon that seat and release

these poor souls from their suffering

and hopefully make things simpler for

the ECDC cleanup crews but it did not

seem quite right to leave without

letting you know what happened and hair

becca was kind enough to succumb to the

sickness without signing out of his

computer so perhaps you were right about

the extinction I've been hunting it for

decades now and while I have seen

evidence of its influence in other

powers I have never found anything to

genuinely prove its emergence as a true

power of its own perhaps it is an

existential fear that flows through the

others like a vein of ore or perhaps the

birth of such things is longer and more

complicated than I believed for all that

though I cannot regret at the time I

have spent seeking it I have done my

duty and none may ask more of me I am

proud of the work we have done and it

has been an honor to do it alongside you

goodbye Gertrude may find your rest when

her shadows are passed and no eyes may

see you slumber statement ends this this

changes things

I think if Martin found this read it

already then perhaps he's having second

thoughts about about Peter and the

extinction this this could be a cry for

help his way of asking me to follow him

without Peter knowing or or what I don't

understand Martin's been quite clear he

doesn't want my help

am I just hearing what I want to hear I

need a second opinion but Becerra and

Daisy are out somewhere they left in a

hurry and didn't tell me why now their

phones are going to voicemail

maybe they're just on the underground

and probably that doesn't help me now I

need someone I can trust

no John you've done enough I just need

to talk what don't you understand she

mutilated herself to get out of that

place and there is absolutely no way I'm

letting you involve her again is she

here or not she she said she was staying

with you yes she's here

really where's all her stuff bedroom why

no I just oh oh I'm sorry I didn't I

didn't realize you were two together

that's cuz it's none of your business

now leave please Georgie it's not I just

need to know I'm not overreacting to

something I need an outside perspective

sure well here's one get out of my flat

Oh what's good what's going on you you

work the Admiral hey hey easy it's all

right he was just leaving

Melanie John yeah it's me it's all right

Melanie John leave I'm sorry I just it's

Martin John don't please no you're right

I'm sorry you all right yes I'm actually

doing okay that's good my therapist

isn't happy about it you know I'm

surprisingly tried to have me put away

but they they let me come here it's it's

been good for me though I feel all right

I'm I'm not scared anymore

Melanie you don't have to do this it's

it's okay he's welcome as a friend but

that's it

but you're not after a friend are you

John I need an ally then I can't help

you supposed okay you've done yeah come

on Melanie let's get you back to bed

look after yourself both of you

you too good luck I guess Thanks hello

Jonathan

I need you said before you knew the

tunnels right so you'd been a part of

them not my exact words but close enough

I need to know what's in there

what's at the center it's important

Martin I need to know that's a shame

because I'm afraid I'm not going to tell

you what why not because I have a good

enough sense of what's going on to know

that it will be much without okay what

you you said you were going to help I am

I don't have time for this what is a

percentage no we're not playing your

game now don't forget well sure I can be

archivist perhaps here now

you're powerful enough to learn what you

want from me but if you try I promise

you I will resist and only one of us is

going to survive the attack

fine can you take me there to the center

I honestly don't know but I'm not

inclined to risk it down you on home

John find a victim on the way chaos is

coming and I think you'd best be ready

to tell me what's going on please

bad things archivist

really
