Martin

Martin he doesn't want to see where are

you

I'm not archivist no one is it's illegal

it's fine then maybe no one cards or

some questions

you've still got time archivist turn

around and you played your part now go

What's Wrong Lucas afraid of talking

face-to-face of course or haven't you

been paying attention

Martin it's odd really you each think

yourself focused on the other but how

much do you really know each other how

much time have you spent together we're

not working or bickering or fleeing from

that latest thing that wants to kill you

so what are you seeking these the image

you've each created of the other the

people you think in love don't exist

that's a very lonely place to be shut up

Martin he doesn't want to see then let

me hear that from him just go make me

unless you can't

the lonely in the eye aren't too far

apart are they not really Goods being

alone if you don't know how alone you

truly are which means well I think

you're worried you know I'll find him

eventually and you know I can find you

for so

Martin John I'm here I came for you

why I thought you might be lost

are you real yes yes I am come on we've

got to get out of here no no I don't

think so why this is where I should be

where I should be it feels right Martin

don't say bad nothing hurts it it's just

quiet even the fear is general here it's

just this isn't right this isn't you

who's there I really loved you you know

listen if he's done something Peters

done something to mess with you

damn it Martin Martin I tried to tell

you he's gone he made his choice and it

wasn't you it was for me though I'm the

reason he I did this to him as much as

you yes suppose you did

where are your friends artists to

massage or a dead

yes days in Becerra are probably dead

because

Georgie and Melanie have left me and

Martin's gone you're alone activist the

last one standing I did warn you I did

want you to leave but perhaps it would

be better if you stayed after all you

can't hurt yes

or perhaps you could answer some

questions what I wouldn't try to leave

if I were you I can see you now I can

find you wherever you go fine it was

just a thought so leave not before I get

some answers that's not going to happen

tell me your story

Peter Lucas no tell me fine fine where

do you want to begin the start on lonely

youth my gradual path to becoming an

only child that's the thing you see I've

had a family faith you've got to double

down on the believers my mother had five

children over her life before my father

finally drifted away she was a Lucas to

the core they're not born into the

family while my father for all he

believed himself keen on a life without

obligation gradually withered away to

nothing as she cultivated the space

between them the house was sprawling our

bedrooms were kept as far apart as

possible and changed often as we were

cared for by a rotating cast of nannies

and tutors you know she's still alive

but I still can't picture my mother's

face with any clarity

and I consider that a blessing I'm not

even burdened by hatred for her she is

simply someone who exists far away from

me it was the sort of childhood that

would not be allowed if we didn't have

money but we're an old family with shall

we say a who remarkably direct line of

inheritance the sort of family where no

social worker would even be allowed on

the property but for all that aside from

a few oddities of faith

I don't know how different my upbringing

was from other Saiyans of aristocracy

from what I understand severing the

connection to your humanity is a

cornerstone of an upper class education

the way it was spared the targeted

traumas of boarding school as my mother

clearly believed the danger of

friendship was too acute I suppose to

call myself an only child is technically

untrue two of my sisters still live

though they disavowed the family and

moved far far away still to be cut off

from one's family as its own very

special sort of loneliness isn't it so

we all serve in our own ways the other

two my brother Haran and sister Judith

well they won't consider it enough to

quietly grow to adulthood and disappear

they simply didn't have the temperament

to thrive in the Lukas household always

trying to instigate games make friends

connect with people as far as I'm aware

they were sent away to live their lives

with very distant relatives never to

return I'm sure it's possible

my mother resolved the matter in a less

pleasant manner but in my limited

interaction with her she never struck me

as a cruel woman and I would imagine for

children that age the fear and isolation

of being uprooted and sent away is just

as strong as that of meeting any more

grisly fate I of course was the favorite

son being quiet and reserved and at all

points deeply engaged with my own

loneliness I have no time for books or

television or any of the escapes and

artificial friendships of affection no I

was myself and that was enough I would

spend my days exploring the white

grounds and forests of our estate

finding the hidden corners I thought

that none would have found before me the

phone now I wonder how many generations

of lucas's had exactly those thoughts in

exactly those spots as soon as I was old

enough I would run away for days at a

time I would take what money I needed

from my mother's purse and hitchhiked

any city I could reach looking back I

realized how odd it was that her purse

was always so full of cash and I believe

it may have been the closest thing I

ever received to her plus by the time I

arrived at whatever destination had

arbitrarily picked it would usually be

night I would walk around the darkened

streets drinking in the sodium Orange

looking at the lit windows of the tower

blocks that surrounded me each one a

small cozy den of warmth and humanity

and reveling in my distance from them

sometimes I would pass another

late-night traveler on the street and I

would hate the they shattered the

distance my cocoon of quiet stillness

and I wished with all my heart that they

would simply disappear and one day one

of them did I still remember him well he

was tall and broad wearing a green

raincoat he clearly bought before middle

age began to set in there was a thin

drizzle that night one of those rains

you can't see believes everything

glistening and

and he was struggling with an umbrella I

tried to pass him quickly but his eyes

met mine and he smiled and asked if I

could help him I can't describe the

feeling that passed through me I can

only say that I told him to go away

and he did or perhaps I did in

retrospect it's hard to be sure which of

us fell out of the populated world but

either way the sense of blissful relief

edged with a strange creeping fear it

was something I never experienced before

it was intoxicating when I returned I

was met by my mother on a small group of

stern-faced relatives that I had never

seen before except at funerals they took

me below the house and showed me the

truth of our family it was difficult to

accept at first not because I didn't

want it to be true but because it seemed

unbelievable that any God could be so

perfectly in tune with my heart I left

the house again shortly after and took

to the sea and never saw my mother again

except of course at funerals

some of my most peaceful memories were

on the tundra I had gathered a small

group of trusted Souls who when you were

loyal and dedicated to my money they had

no qualms or morals about what we did on

that boat and my request each sign to

the ship under a false name so I would

never have to know who they were those

lonely nights of sacrifice and waiting

hearing the dreadful sound of my

ancestors whistle drift over the dark

and brooding waters knowing another soul

was leaving this world god I wish I was

there now locked in my cabin staring

over the quiet emptiness of the open

ocean but it's moored now and I came on

wind at elias's request my crew is out

there waiting for a call I think I am

now unlikely ever to give them I will

call him Elias well that's how I've

known him for most of our acquaintance

though I originally met him and he was

still James right head of the Magnus

Institute I considered him a dull little

man at first so keen to watch other

peoples and misery to lose himself in

second and pain and drama exactly the

sort of thing I've always been so keen

to avoid Gertrude was the one that

scared me

she seemed to have no interest in

meeting me whatsoever something I

appreciate it but there was something in

her eyes when she looked at me as though

she was making a calculation and I was

an unwanted integer

she was deciding whether to remand it

wasn't until much later that I realized

exactly how true that was still it seems

I was never oppressing enough concern

for her to sail out after me or even

wait until I made port and waylay me I

suppose even she couldn't have predicted

her

turn out thinking about it now perhaps

one of the reasons I lost it as long as

I did was that I was at the end of the

day predictable unknown quantity I had

my little patch sending my poor lost

sailors to their forsaken land but I

rarely stepped outside of it when I

think of all those I met who traveled in

this secret world we found ourselves in

Gertrude Simon minik I'll even Rayna

there are plenty whose lives might well

have been easier with my death but it

was rare that I strayed outside my

habits maybe that's why when I crossed

paws with a de Lawd deca we ended up

talking and he told me his theory of the

extinction something that stayed with me

even after he died pursuing it the thing

is the loneliness I crave that fills my

heart with that reassuring unease relies

on distance from other people but a

world without people at all or at least

anything I would recognize as people it

is meaningless without the lighted

window in the distance how am I to see

myself apart from it no such a world

would be terribly dull and scares me in

a very different way a fear I am happy

to offer up of course but one that I

would prefer not come to pass my

instinct was much like the others I

thought that if I could complete my

ritual first when the potential birth of

the dreadful change would be meaningless

I started it shortly before Steinman

convinced me to join him with his little

space experiment it was interesting of

course but in the end a tremendous waste

of money just to scare a single

astronaut but I had it in my mind that

it might distract from my true it out

I had commissioned the services of

architects designers and sociologists

all under a variety of pretenses and we

secured a plot of land near Aldgate East

I was going to build a tower block on my

very own oh it was a marvel of design

deceptively spacious apartments yet no

rune quite big enough

for a double bed or decent sized sofa

cooking facilities that seemed adequate

until you tried to do more than

microwave an office space in every flat

but without a door so you can never

truly escape your work none of them had

more than a single bedroom though each

had a main bathroom and an ensuite which

is a small touch I was very proud of the

lower floor levels were left

deliberately empty so anyone living

there could only see the people below

from a distance the whites of the city

that day were removed from the windows

were thick and every wall had

soundproofing inside it the corridors

were full of false doors so even though

each floor was designed to minimize the

probability of residents encountering

each other it would seem as though they

were crowded in by doors that would not

open

if knocked on I made the elevators very

small then I offered the rooms at a

ridiculously low price for their central

London location and then screams the

applicants mercilessly I prioritized

those who were newly moved to the city

graduates who needed cheap accommodation

and we're moving into intensive

high-stress jobs that would give them

little time for socialising recent

divorces also very suitable especially

those whose friends had sighted with

their partner I crammed them in pushing

them to stew in a cocktail of distant

lights empty corridors and

warm takeout for one the plan was to

wait until those inside reached a

critical mass of loneliness and despair

then all at once locked them in remotely

cut off their internet and phone lines

and leave them to die alone in their

single occupancy professional duels as

the Forsaken emerged from their terror I

called it the silence though to be

honest it was mainly because I thought

they had to have names can't say if the

title was desperately inspired then of

course

Gertrude Robinson happened do you know

how she did it

what a devastating weapon she used to

derail my plan the newspaper she tipped

off someone in The Guardian I still

remember seeing the headline there in

black and white the loneliest building

in Britain trouble is every one I picked

was white middle-class said people

actually cared falling over themselves

to declare it emblematic of the problems

of the modern world the thing pieces

started to pour in the applications

started to drop off and it was up to my

neck in community outreach programs no

way to salvage it years of my life and a

sizeable fortune down the drain she

didn't even have the decency to kill me

they really knocked me back took me

years to find myself again I returned to

the tundra tried to forget but the

trouble was I tasted the game now I was

still hungry for more

I suppose that's why I was so keen when

Elias contacted me we kept in touch of

course my family helped fund the

Institute and he'd always been good

about tipping me off to potential

victims going through something horrific

can leave you feeling very isolated

indeed especially if you know no one

else will believe and of course he knew

I find it hard to resist a wager if I

could convince one of his staff to

willingly pledge themselves to be lonely

it was all mine he even let me picked

the victim he was so sure the price of

the Institute the panopticon and a

willing vessel to use it would be just

too much for me to resist and he was

right just didn't go quite as I'd hoped

you know this is one of the first bats I

ever made with him I've actually lost

but I guess that's how hustlers work

isn't it they lose and lose until you're

willing to put it all on the line and

then the trap shots so I suppose that's

probably why I reacted so rashly trying

to rip his victory away keep you here

but it looks like I might have

underestimated my opponent once again

what was his prize what did he get if

you lost oh he got you I don't

understand

and you won't not from me I'm done

tell me I'm not saying another will tell

me or I will rip it out of him No

answer my question No

Partin he's gone now Martin he's gone

his only wish was to die alone he was

denying tough an out listen to me Martin

listen hello John listen I know you

think you want to be here I know you

think it's safer and well maybe it is

but we need you I need you no you don't

know really

everyone's alone but we all survive I

don't just want to survive I'm sorry man

one look at me look at me you tell me

what you see I see

I see you John John I see you Martin oh

I was on my own it's all my hair not

anymore

come on let's go home

oh don't worry I know the way
