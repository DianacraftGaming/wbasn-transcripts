statement of Donna Gwynne regarding an unlicensed archeological dig near the Red Sea in Egypt 

original statement given May 20th 2015

#### ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

you'll forgive me if I'm vague on the details I have to be 

the job I was on at the time was a long way from legal and even if the courts could never prove it 

let's just say the people I worked for take privacy very seriously 

in beed all names I give here aside from my own are aliases 

it's hard to get a job in archaeology these days I mean 

I guess it always was but education funding is being squeezed across the board and the fact is most higher up positions in the fields tend to only open up once the previous occupant dies 

it's sad but if you look at a full lecture hall on the archeology course of any major university you can be pretty sure that none of the people you're looking at are going to end up doing it for a living

a few might get assistant positions on a project or two but the long thankless hours an endless grind to climb a ladder already full up with old posh men will probably change their minds 

I suppose what I'm saying is I was never going to be a real archeologist 

so when I got a chance to do some unlicensed work I figured it was either that or trained to be a teacher and I hate children 

see the thing is that there's a lot of very valuable stuff in the ground

ancient artifacts 

for God and knowledge all that good stuff but acquiring it takes a lot of time a lot of money and a lot of fiddly licenses and permissions

not to mention that government's can get very grabby when it comes to the prizes of antiquity

you can't take three steps in this field without some wannabe indiana jones declaring something or other belongs in a museum

but museums have very limited budgets and the private market has a never-ending appetite for valuable ancient treasures 

so you have my industry which is like normal archaeology but a bit more

preform 

I like to think of myself as a rogue archaeologist but I think most people would just call me a grave robber

which is daft because half the time it isn't even graves we're dealing with 

but that makes surprisingly little difference in terms of legality 

I worked for a man named Starr Bo 

I still might

I'm not sure 

he doesn't really make contact when we don't have a job and this one ended badly enough that I'm not sure whether or not I'm getting another call 

I hope so I really don't want to be a teacher 

he first contacted me three years ago after funding fell food for my second PhD 

and some professional disputes meant that the chances of my career continuing were somewhere between zero and no 

he was very to the point with me explaining right away that he organized rapid to turn around illegal digs taking whatever high-value finds were transportable and selling them to private collectors 

he had plenty of labour security and organizational support but he needed someone on staff to identify and quickly appraise artifacts or other discoveries 

he had previously had a disgraced anthropology professor from Harvard but he'd apparently been busted smuggling a few extras through customs in China and was no longer available 

star Bo said I was just the right choice to fill the position I agreed on the spot 

I never did do great with the ethical aspects of my field

I love the hunt the research and the discovery but to be honest expanding the body of mankind's knowledge or helping a culture connect with its roots has never been high on my priority list 

certainly not as high as money so for the next few years I traveled the globe with starve oh and his team 

there was me geologist I'll call Grigory Norman who was the middleman to various antiques dealers auction houses and less respectable museums 

and a pair of quiet Albanians Barry and Paul who acted as the muscle

well they did the majority of it but starve oh didn't like it when people put their feet up on a job 

so me gregorian norman spent most of the time working a spade alongside them 

as our expertise generally came in useful in the latter half of the dig 

I like to think I earned my keep 

certainly there were plenty of times Barry was all set to toss out some priceless treasure because took it for dusty trash and starvin never complained

this last dig was high-risk 

starve oh and Norman had ears in the appropriate offices of most universities and museums 

so he got word that the Egyptian government had denied permission for the University of Pennsylvania to look into a possible tomb complex located between Cairo and the Red Sea again 

I won't go into specifics but it was right in the middle of the eastern desert a good 30 or 40 miles from the closest known explored pyramid or tomb 

if the university researchers were right this place could be both a significant find 

and more importantly for us completely untouched 

it was dangerous though 

when a government denied permission like this you could never be sure that they weren't going to send people of their own instead 

and starve Oh had plenty of stories of ex colleagues that had got themselves inadvertently arrested when military abruptly turned up to secure a dig site 

still the opportunity was too good to pass up and starve our had some contacts within the Cairo police force so was able to get us a pair of well bribed policemen to stick around and give us at least a passing air of respectability for any civilian who might stumble across us 

so off I went to Egypt dreaming of finding a new pyramid

I know that sounds daft but most pyramids are not as huge obvious or intact as those at Giza 

after four or five thousand years most just look like Hills or sometimes dunes and there could be any number of them waiting undiscovered beneath the Egyptian earth

I was surprised by how easily we found it 

starve our would gotten a location from the university's application and Gregori quickly located a likely-looking geological formation on the satellite images 

less than 14 hours after I got the call I was standing shovel in hand in the middle of the eastern desert breaking ground over a tomb that had been unopened for millennia 

it was exhilarating

grigory had done some work to make sure we were digging or what he believed to be the entrance 

and it only took a day to unearth the slab of limestone that covered it 

I could see hieroglyphics itched onto the surface but they were far too worn to read 

large upon the stone carved 

the closed loop of a Shen ring

the symbol of infinity 

this struck me as odd since just based on the entrance I was pretty sure this tomb was at least Fourth Dynasty and the Shan ring was usually used to designate a royal burial place 

but there were no cartouche is among the hieroglyphics on the entrance

which I would have expected of the tomb contained royalty 

it was a subterranean pyramid I was now quite certain 

but if it has the remains of a pharaoh their name had not been protected upon death

Barry and Paul wasted no time in hoisting the limestone slab off the entrance  revealing a dark yawning passage 

in the heat of the Sun I was acutely aware of the cold draft seeping out of the opening 

star bo gave it a look over and asked if there was anything we could salvage from the hieroglyphics

I gave him directions to chip off the Shen ring and take photos of the rest

relate to study 

before you asked I don't have access to those photos

stavos still has the camera 

you know 

in my haste to make sure everything was going smoothly it hadn't really hit me what we had found until that moment 

as I stood on the threshold and breathed air four thousand years old 

it was dry 

it's multi aint leav cedarwood 

I just helped discover an untouched tomb of the forth Ennis T 

we collected our backs picks and torches and headed into the dark 

two things struck me as soon as we were inside 

the first was how big the place was 

the passages were far wider than I would have assumed based on my research on comparable tombs 

the other was that there was also significantly less ornamentation 

and by less I mean none

the walls were bare unpainted and for a horrible moment I thought it might already have been ransacked 

star var had the same thought but Gregory assured us that the condition of the entrance indicated it hadn't been opened since it was originally sealed 

the tomb hadn't been robbed it was just empty 

as we had to deeper I began to notice passages branching off our paths 

in each case they seemed to be heading more or less back the way we came

I called the Holton starvin 

and I took a few minutes to explore one of them first

they seemed to be heading back towards the surface but further corridors branched off 

until we finally reached a dead end 

then another and another 

it took longer than I was comfortable with to find the others again 

it was a labyrinth not entirely unlike the one found at hvar ax 

but crucially it seems to only assume its deceptive maze-like form when heading back towards the entrance 

when walking deeper in it was rather straightforward

I made these observations to starve oh and he immediately headed back out and returned carrying the end of the jeeps winch 

it was a hundred and fifty feet in total and he figured if the tomb ended up going deeper than that we should probably reconsider our approach entirely 

I could see he was getting irritated by these delays and the lack of obviously bankable artifacts

I couldn't blame him I was starting to feel quite on edge myself 

as it turned out the winch finished just within sight of the central chamber so he tied a torch to the end and headed inside 

like the rest this room was simple and plain built out of rough limestone 

it was completely empty save for a raised Dyess at the centre about three feet off the floor 

lying there were the remains of an unpainted wooden sarcophagus 

it had long since rotted away though 

the uncharacteristic copper bands that wrapped it still seemed in good condition 

among the debris I could see the pale wrapping of the corpse tight around in a way that reminded me disconcertingly of a straitjacket 

it had worn away in many places

even the flesh of the mummy itself on show dark black and almost shiny 

in the torchlight there was nothing else there at all

no treasures and no other exits

it was at that point that starve old lost it a bit 

he'd spent a lot of money on this expedition and to find that there was nothing there except an old corpse and some shards of wood was a significant problem for him 

I mean the architectural implications of the place in terms of mid to late fourth dynasty construction practices were kind of amazing but I didn't think that was something he wanted to hear just then 

so I kept quiet we all did when starve Oh God anger he was best to just let it run its course rather than trying to talk him down from it and draw his anger your way 

I dizzy to myself making another loop of the room in case there were any secret entrances that I'd missed 

while behind me he stood there swearing 

I did notice something in the corner though

about a half-dozen small bones with carvings on each face 

dice 

I knew the dice games predated the Old Kingdom by sometime and these were excellent quality I decided to wait until Star borough had finished ranting before I drew his attention to them 

I turned to see him leaning over the corpse rage on his face like it was somehow this dead Egyptians fault that the trip had been a bust 

I had to stop myself laughing until I saw that he might actually punch the thing 

the mummy was the only thing in that place aside from the dice that we had any hope of selling and I couldn't let him damage it 

I shouted at him to stop in his eyes fixed on me with hatred burning behind them 

I explained to him calmly and reasonably that the mummified a body before him might be worth a lot of money 

this did seem to calm him down a bit and he was just starting to apologize for his outburst when he went completely still 

his eyes were wide and he had gone deathly pale 

I stepped a bit closer and as my torch traveled down from his face and along his arm 

I saw it

a blackened desiccated hand gripping his wrist the thin fingers clenched tight 

he was moving

he was alive 

it opened its eyes but beneath those brittle eyelids with empty crevices where they had long since rotted away 

it opened his mouth as though to scream but no sound came out at all

I remember thinking of course it can't scream he doesn't have any lungs 

lack of jars man 

this would have been a cheaper mummification and they would have liquefied all the organs over the course of seventy days 

was this thing alive when that had happened 

was it buried in salt for seventy days 

feeling the cedar oil slowly melting its insides 

these thoughts ran rapidly through my mind as I stood there frozen in terror 

the sound of starves pistol shocked me out of my stupor 

he always carried a gun when he went on a dangerous job and he was emptying it into the glassy flesh of the mummy 

before him each shots and shards of dry skin and dusty bone flying off it but it didn't stop moving not even when he shoved the gun in the corpses mouth and blew off the back of its skull 

it had released him now the star vote turned to see the others had already fled back from the chamber heading towards the surface following the cable back 

a strange half-dead creature had spasmed its way off the raised platform now onto the floor and lay between me and star beau

and the door he gave me an apologetic look and then ran leaving me alone with the thing 

the broken shuddering mummy began to drag itself towards me 

it was still partially bound in the tight burial cloth but that didn't stop it making it's painstaking way over the dusty ground 

there was plenty of room to run around it it wasn't even that fast but my legs just wouldn't work 

as it got closer and closer its mouth opened and closed stiffly 

dark brown dust falling from it in a steady stream 

I have no idea how it knew I was there 

he had no eyes no nose there's no way it should have been able to detect me 

but it knew and crawled directly towards me I managed to reach to my hip and pull out my own weapon 

a large hunting knife I'd picked up on our last trip to North America more because its weight had given me a sense of security than because I knew how to use it 

I waved it at the approaching corpse but there was no reaction 

when I felt it's cold leathery fingers gripped my shin it was like the panic pushed my mind so far that it suddenly snapped back into place I gripped the night in both hands leaned forward and plunged it into the things throat 

the blade sank in with a dry creaking sound the Mummy's arms shot up to grip it 

I almost threw up from the feeling of its blackened dead hands on line but it was astoundingly strong 

twitching it pulled my hands away dragging the knife out of its throat and moving my arm down positioning the point of the blade on its chest where the heart should be 

then it made me push the knife in 

the poor creature hung there for a second then pulled the knife out and made me stab it again 

over and over it made me do it while its torso racked and convulsed 

it almost seemed like it was crying but without tear ducts or lungs there was no way to know

after the fifth time it had made me snap it it loosened its grip on my hand enough that I could release the knife

with a burst of adrenaline I took to my feet and fled

luckily STOVL hadn't withdrawn the Jeep's winch cable yeah toils 

God knows how long I'd have been trapped down there especially since when I emerged into the intense sunlight of the desert I found Paul and Barry arguing over the best way to replace the slab over the entrance 

it took many hours to Ribery it completely but when we were done it was like no one had ever been there 

Stav Oh didn't say a word as we drove away 

in ancient Egypt dying was the most important thing a person would ever do

your whole life was preparation for it

readying yourself and acquiring what you would need for the journey back when the Nile was the source of all that kept you alive the land of the living 

but as you got further from it from very earth itself became hostile to you unable to support any sort of life at all 

it was there at the outskirts the edge of life itself that they built their tombs and pyramids 

I cannot imagine what they would have thought of a person who could not die 

I can't imagine what they would have done to them

end statement 

if there's one thing I hate more than statements that can only be followed up by making contact with uncooperative foreign agencies 

it is statements where everyone involved is a criminal who either cannot be tracked down or is unwilling to discuss their business in any way 

this statement manages to neatly combine the two in such a way that any verification or follow-up has proven utterly impossible 

the only thing I have found is that Miss Gwyn is now training to become a teacher 

I can't deny I find a certain cruel satisfaction in that fact

I feel anyone who brings me a statement about mummies deserves everything they get

#### BASIRA

you can't just come down to the station

asking 

I'm sorry I didn't think 

no you didn't 

now I've got a whole bunch of questions being asked

they're keeping tabs on me at work 

I just wanted to see you 

next tape 

yeah I get it but right now I can't do anything about that 

because I feel like they're watching me all the time 

I mean if that's the case 

should you even have come down here 

it's fine it's it's just work 

but if there's one thing I've learned it's that you and me we suck at this whole spy thing 

and it's 

wait until things calm down a bit

keep me updated I suppose 

yeah if I can

stay safe

End supplement.
