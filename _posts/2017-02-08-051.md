#### ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

i should be dead really 

it's a weird feeling 

you ever had a near-death experience 

I've had a few they're not uncommon in my line of work but this it feels different 

it's not that I put myself in danger and managed not to die 

I should be dead 

the compression sickness that severe is almost never survivable and I should have had an embolism 

the fact that I didn't blind luck 

it's hard to reconcile yourself with avoiding a death that you feel should have been yours 

if there'd been others with me who didn't make it if I could write it off as survivor's guilt 

but I was alone 

do you ever get that 

of course you don't sorry 

anyway I'm not here to talk about the bends 

I'm a diver both by nature and by trade 

I grew up in Halifax Nova Scotia and was swimming almost before I was walking 

I did my first scuba dive at 8 years old

it was barely deeper than a swimming pool but it was enough to instill a lifelong passion for it 

I got fully qualified as soon as I was legally able and almost flunked out of college because I was always running off to some dive or other

I must have missed more classes than I went to by the end 

I scraped by but as it turned out even if I hadn't it wouldn't have mattered too much 

as it wasn't my psychology major that got me my first job after graduation it was diving 

I worked at a marine salvage company based off the coast of Nova Scotia 

you'll forgive me if I don't give their name I still hold out hope I might go back to work there someday and I'd feel like an asshole dragging their name through the mud 

even if it is just to you and your strict confidentiality procedures 

if you're desperate they shouldn't be hard to identify 

but it's not really 

and what happened 

you ever heard of the graveyard of the Atlantic 

probably not and it's a confusing name anyway since it actually refers to two distinct locations along the eastern coast of North America

both notorious hotspots for shipwrecks

in this case I'm talking about the one of Sable Island in Nova Scotia 

the waters there are some of the roughest 

where the Gulf Stream hits the Labrador Current and depending on which historical records you believe there could be anything from four to six hundred shipwrecks down there 

that's only from when the European settlers first arrived 

normally it's not the sort of place where we would accept jobs it's too dangerous to send a salvage crew in when the waters of that unpredictable

but this time was different maybe the old man was just a real sweet talker  or maybe he swept the captain 

leathery old cuss by the name of Morton Kemp 

just enough extra under the table that he fudged the location on the release forms

either way word came down that we were doing a dive off Sable Island 

none of that was to say the captain was stupid about it 

we kept a very close eye on the meteorological reports and only headed into the graveyard when we were certain or we'd have a window of relatively calm seas to do it 

it helped that the job was relatively simple

the old man Simon Fairchild had come to us claiming that he had pinpointed the location he believed his great-grandfather's sailing yacht had been sunk almost 120 years ago and he was keen to retrieve any heirlooms or curios he could from it 

the only thing interesting or unusual about his story was the amount of money he was willing to throw around to back it up 

it was certainly enough to get his dropping anchor a hundred miles from the coast on a hot sunny morning at the end of August

the journey out had been a bit subdued normally Mian Julio and andis the other diver on the crew would spend our time chatting playing cards and once even screwing 

though we generally don't talk about that 

this time we had to babysit mr. Fairchild who had stubbornly insisted that he make the journey with us 

again this wouldn't normally have been an option but the guy was not shy about throwing his money around 

he must have been pushing a hundred years old just a tiny pink skeleton of a man sat in the corner watching us the whole trip

it was hard to get any sort of friendly chat going him perched there like some sort of vulture 

I tried to talk to him a few times but he only seemed interested in discussing this shipwreck and how preserved I thought everything might be

I told him I had no idea it really wasn't my area I was just the diver 

he didn't say much to me after that 

when we hit the graveyard the sea was almost completely still 

far more so than I would have expected even given the weather predictions we'd been working on

it didn't strike me as odd at the time just an unexpected bit of help with the job 

initial checks managed to locate a wreck that seemed to match the old man's description 

a steam yacht circa 1890 

it seems to be in surprisingly good shape and in the cameras torch light we could just about make out the name the maria fairchild 

the old man was practically dancing with joy and I was genuinely concerned he might give himself a heart attack

we suited up and prepared to go under

the wreck was at a depth of 160 feet which meant we'd be in a high-pressure environment but we shouldn't need hypoxic gas or full pressure suits which was something of a relief

Julio made his prayers captain Kemp gave us a stern knot and into the water we went 

as I went in I thought I heard Simon the old man shout after me but I couldn't make it out 

and then the world was nothing but silent blue 

I had expected the water to be warmer given the temperature on the surface but the chill hit me all at once and it took a moment to get to grips with it 

I saw Julio next to me a few yards away and with a thumbs up we began to dive down towards the sunken boat 

most people don't appreciate how quickly it gets dark underwater you don't need to be nearly as deep as you think before the Sun is just the faintest change in the water hues 

if you're not careful it's easy to forget which way is up and become lost in the murky depths 

but Julio and I were a well-practiced team and we weren't going so far down us to face any darkness that our torches couldn't handle 

it was during that descent when I saw  there are two points of light were the only signs of movement down there

but I noticed the absence of life 

I wasn't particularly worried by this 

if anything I was rather relieved anyone who's been diving more than a few years will be able to tell you of at least one close call with a shark and I'd had two

so far so the less removed the better as far as I was concerned

still it was a surprise that we haven't seen even a single school of fish on our journey to the seafloor and once we were down there it was just as lifeless 

i gestured my confusion to julio but he just shrugged and started over towards the rack 

down there deep below the surface I find myself sometimes entering an almost meditative state 

you can feel the weight of the world 

a world you were never meant to be part 

of pressing in on you from all directions 

and a constant overpowering awareness of your own breathing 

of how little there is between you and the very space around you that is completely hostile to your existence

the danger is real as is the faint hardened fear in your gut 

I've always found that it sometimes put me in a state not too unlike how it feels staring into the flames of a fire

hypnotic 

my mind cleared of all thoughts but the dull pulsing rush of adrenaline

that feeling was so strong here that I almost went past them 

or airfare Charles completely 

Julio was already inside and I quickly located a large enough tear in the hull and made my own entrance 

the yacht was bigger than I had thought when viewing it from the boat but the layout was not complicated 

and we already had quite a good idea about where would be best to look for the sort of antiques and sentimental treasures that Simon wanted 

Julio had taken the bedroom so I started on the bridge 

it was certainly an impressive sight a late 19th century steam yacht slightly decayed from its time on the ocean floor but all-in-all astoundingly well-preserved 

I looked over the chair in the various panels and controls but could find nothing which could be classed as an easily removable heirloom 

although I did make a metal note of which bits of the bridge were well enough preserved they might be worth removing 

it would need more equipment than we had with us but I could suggest it to Simon if we returned empty-handed

I checked in on Julio but he was still busy ransacking the bedroom so I decided to do sweep at the engine room 

it was there I found the hole 

it was large maybe seven feet in diameter not unlike the one I had used to get into the wreck in the first place

there was something about it that immediately put me on edge the shape was to regular somehow 

the water outside it was too dark 

and it took me a few seconds to notice this but the direction of the tearing seemed to indicate it had been made from the inside out

I dropped the rusted wrench I had been examining and let it float slowly towards the floor as I made my way to the hole 

I groped to the side looked through 

as soon as I put my head through I felt a change wash over me

the pressure increased all at once becoming so intense that I screamed in surprise in pain as my head erupted in agony 

the pressure was upon my whole body now and I was finding it hard to move with the crushing weight on every part of me 

my eyes bulged as I stared forward and I saw two things 

the first was that below the hole there was no seafloor just a deep and endless expanse of empty water as though the boat were on a cliff edge

the second was that it was far far too dark

the deepest that humans can survive in the ocean is the mesopelagic zone which begins roughly 650 feet below the surface 

is colloquially known among oceanographers is the Twilight Zone as it is the level where only the faintest of light penetrates from the Sun 

and the water can only be seen in the many shades of darkness 

down that far any glow that makes it is so diffused as to be utterly useless in determining which way is up 

but as I stared out in terror I was absolutely sure that there was no

and I could swim as far as I liked there would never be anything but water 

then I saw it 

it was only a shadow in the dark but it was there and it was huge it stretched from one side of my vision to the other 

and as I fought against the pressure to turn my aching head I still couldn't see the end of it 

only its blurred outline was slightly better contrasted against the lighter shade of the Twilight water that surrounded it 

I could not see the ends of it it was so big it made me lightheaded to think about it to try and place myself in some believable scale against it 

I think it was a hand but I could not see enough to be sure 

then it moved slowly but clearly and I realized how far away it still was as it got bigger and bigger and bigger and I could see nothing else and I screamed 

it was the jagged metal of the hole itself that saved me in the end 

as I cried out in horror I felt the sharp edges of it digging into my hands and they gripped it the unexpected burst of pain snapped me out of whatever it was that held me in place 

with a surge of strength I pushed myself back into the boat I felt the pressure lift all at once 

of course this brought its own set of problems but I didn't care the lightheadedness was already setting in and my vision was blurry when I swam out of the sunken ship and headed towards the surface at full speed ignoring all decompression procedures 

I blacked out thirty feet from the surface 

I have vague memories of the trip Mac fading in and out of consciousness feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life

then I recall a helicopter shouting and finally waking up fully in a hospital

bed captain Kemp was there and he immediately laid into me calling me all sorts of horrendous names before informing me exactly how serious my condition had been and how lucky I was to be alive 

I should be dead he told me

and I know he was right 

I left the company soon afterwards 

I still planned to go back someday but it'll be a while longer before I'm comfortable in the water again 

Julio never came to visit me in hospital and I was unable to get in contact with him after I was discharged

I hope he's all right

I did ask captain Kemp what happened to the job after I left as I also hadn't seen the old man since that morning 

the captain got a strange look in his eyes then and gazed out of the window with a scowl I had never seen on his face before 

the sea is a dangerous place he said and walked away 

#### ARCHIVIST

statement ends

no real follow-up can be made to this statement as it all took place in Canadian territory we don't have the contacts over there that we do here 

not to mention the one little I could glean appears to be a mass of overlapping and conflicting police coastguard and Port Authority reports

we could spend years trying to unravel this one case if we had a mind to and I for one do not 

we weren't even able to beam sufficient information to track down any of those mentioned in the statement

aside from captain Morton Kemp who now runs boat tours near Winnipeg and declined to comment on it in the strongest possible terms 

instead I will focus on Simon Fairchild who I recall may have come up in case zero zero two two zero one zero 

along with a young woman 

I may have encountered Fairchild before or it may just be a coincidence of names 

one of my first cases as a researcher for the Institute in 2012 was looking into the history of a jewelers in Hackney that have reported cases becoming cracked in the night 

nothing was ever taken but each morning it would be like a heavy weight had been dropped upon them 

looking into it it turned out that the jewels had in the 1930s belongs to a con artist and fence who had attracted the displeasure of the local population 

when one particularly irate customer threw him out of a fourth floor window into a crowded street at midday

no one claimed to have seen anything

a minor possible haunting with the decidedly pedestrian backstory 

but notable because while I was never able to discover the original name of the con artist one of his many many aliases was Simon Fairchild 

and it appeared on several business listings around the time 

whether it's a coincidence or not as something of a moot point at this stage 

however the cursory bit of research reveals the Fairchild's in question to be an exceptionally wealthy family based down in Cornwall 

no real business to speak of but it appears they've invested very wisely in aerospace technology shipping logistics and underwater drilling and construction

whatever their origin I feel it's worth keeping an eye on them

Supplemental.

Had a strange conversation with Sasha earlier today. 

I have been doing some research into her but there's little to go on, save that she worked an artifact storage

I decided to pay it a short visit to acquaint myself with any new acquisitions 

not much worth reporting, really. a new oak wardrobe light is apparently unable to penetrate 

a carved rock 

I they keep in a black velvet bag

apparently it interferes with the video cameras otherwise 

and a rather nasty-looking scalpel that is supposedly rife with the disease no matter what they used to sterilize or disinfect it

that one's kept in a hermetically sealed plastic box 

I stumbled across Sasha staring at that damn table again 

luckily I had the wherewithal to bring my tape recorder and managed to turn it on unnoticed 

recording follows 

it's fascinating isn't it 

in the literal sense 

I mean 

yes 

sometimes I can't pull myself away from it 

given recent events

ugh 

I've been trying to figure out if it's a fractal 

no no it isn't 

I've always seen it more like a web 

I guess

it has Quartus in its own way 

I don't think we're the first to be caught 

no 

I believe it caught Graham as well 

I thought that was i whatever crawl through his window 

unless you think they're linked somehow 

I doubt it

it didn't sound like the sort of thing that would want to be bound to an object

I suppose and we haven't seen any long-limbed stalkers 

so let's concentrate on the table 

degrees 

if you'll excuse me 

of course 

odd but not alarming 

though I think I may discuss restricting her access to the table with Elias 

oh and I found out where she's been going when she takes extra-long lunch breaks

it seems harmless enough, but I admit I'm a bit baffled. 

Every few days she travels up to Baker Street to spend anywhere from 10 minutes to a 4-hour Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.
