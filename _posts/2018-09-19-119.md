please 

right now 

what we have here is our handheld remote detonator 

what 

it talks to a bottle 

wait

I imagine if you'd use it we'd all have come to quite the nast end

that was 

don't you worry archivist it's all in good hands 

I don't understand 

and you never will again

John I don't think none of it none of

this is really but it is just because

lie

who are you oh yeah Tim of course who

else would I be

you're not dead just like you wanted get

away from me I swear

[Music]

do you even know which of these hands is

your sister started off this does not it

slams velvet do you even know what a

hand is pathetic wait wait I know I

would hope you do how are you here

Houston I'm here because you say I tried

I tried

you almost let three unacceptably baby

no no I would I could have stopped them

ha you didn't even know what it was

do you know how many people I killed in

to keep the world in one piece the

sacrifices I made and you didn't even

know what you were fighting

no I didn't I suppose it's of no

consequence now it's far too late what

can I do

you put a screen why are you doing this

I'm not you know it's probably for the

best I'm dead can you imagine how

I hate having to watch you up all around

was my replacement

I really cannot express how much of a

disappointment you are I'm sorry I

didn't leave my probably use to stop the

stream during its tracks and you didn't

even notice when they desecrated my

course and now look at me

you've made me part of a ritual this is

your fault it is not it's not I didn't

know it's not my fault you died as well

why why didn't he warn me it would be

like this I've hardly had the chance to

die before you left me to get my head

bashed in I understand I don't know the

conversation was anything to go by I

hardly think you can blame your father

so some will reach children your

problems go far deeper just to give me

anything to give me a moment you're

gonna please you thinking that

honestly if I wasn't so dead I'd be

impressed I always thought my own

humorous to be quite exceptional

the youth somehow delivered a bit more

bad decisions into two years and I

managed to the live charter but by all

means take your moment what do you want

no I just want you to join me almost a

shame you don't know your own coffin for

you will

[Music]

don't panic don't panic just close your

eyes all right ignore the don't listen

focus think think this is a place you

you and you're in a place now if if it's

a place and it's a noun then then then

it then it has an edge the other thing

is does too much to touch this there's

too many and they wanna hurt me so so

you leave the place you leave the place

and the now no place is forever know how

to move

so it's do it pick away then there move

[Music]

good then they keep moving keep moving

until you find another place a place you

know just keep moving

keep moving

[Music]

do you feel it

harvest it's almost up there the new day

a terrible new world it is all your

though I suppose you never really had a

chance I see you do you know yes yes I

see the sad clown

it's over than hateful I see him he

finding his way to us in the circus

where nobody knew him I seem to torn

apart becoming the mask remade by a

cruel ringmaster sometimes a doll

sometimes I'm a mannequin he always

hiding in somebody else's skin somebody

else is in pain not always and it's far

too late for any of that nothing you see

can help you

not without the detonator don't you just

probably the hunters idea she killed one

of the couriers Oh big house ma'am she

was also the one that damaged this shell

it's a shell Sara and soon you will have

tens of

you can have your little your within

every dark corner of the whole world not

until you finish the Sun oh just let me

enjoy myself no moment this is a once in

eternity event after all this in between

is not as comfortable for all of us as

it is for you

oh by archivist it's been a pleasure but

I believe all of you

[Applause]

what do you see I see my Apple busts

wait wait wait boy it was broadened Tim

Moldy once a long time ago before all

Zenith made me and some time it was even

now for special occasions like your

brother Sean Tim what's in your hand

it's I don't

the detonator that's quite enough from

human races see if you can do it again

before I can squeeze it's too late won't

help you now so come and take it

that's what thought I am losing my

patient back get back

that's right John I don't know if you

can hear me but if you can then I don't

forgive you thank you for this you idiot

do you really make the world fair any

better under the watch you think you're

saving anyone I don't care you can't

even say hey but I can hurt you it will

not end tonight like this you sound

stressed you know I hear the great

Grimaldi's in town

you should go seeing cheer yourself up

on that knot I know
