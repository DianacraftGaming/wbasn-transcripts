are you quite all right

yeah just your tape recorder it's old I

get that a lot

I just mean I've been thinking about

analog and digital what we mean by them

in terms of information yeah we use the

word digital to refer to one specific

way of storing information discrete

signal values interpreted at

pre-established levels analog is just a

fancy way of saying everything else

almost everything in the world is analog

but we're obsessed with digital we try

to surrender everything into it break

the world down and turn it into as much

binary as it takes but it's not the same

I used to work on OCR programs teaching

computers to read to take the messy

physicality of the written word and

convert it into something that a

computer can understand in a digital

format I'm not sure what this has to do

with my tape recorder

magnetic tape everyone thinks it's

analog but it's digital a lower tech

version than what we use now but people

forget that it was used to store

computerized data for decades maybe it

reminds people of a film reel or or

maybe nostalgia turns everything analog

although people always think of digital

as not really there but the thing is

information is always physically present

it doesn't exist as some formulas

nothing even within the tiniest most

advanced storage systems physical memory

cells change and alter themselves to

render that information in a language

all of their own I suppose it isn't

language not really because because

language as we use it is about as far

from digital as you can get or we may

call them words but the units of data

that a computer works with are by their

nature discrete and definite well the

words we use our clumsy vague things

always at the whim of interpretation and

decay or it's the obvious thing to say

that a computer cannot feel but it's

true no sequence of distinct ones and

zeros can replicate the swirling

cocktail of chemicals and and you know

nerves that is a human being or any

other animal for

oh nothing about humanity is binary

right so you work in computers then

sorry I am it's been a while since I

talked to someone in person been

spending a lot of time in my own head

you know used to just dumping

information when I get the chance I have

a blog actually but I haven't posted for

almost a year

almost too embarrassed to now assuming

I'm not losing my mind of course yes I

hear that a lot

well that's what's terrifying isn't it

your mind is all you are there's no

backup

you know reset if it goes I'm not just

talking about madness as it appears but

what it is from inside the way people

talk about it it's like you have to

think you're saying that our mind is

everything we perceive everything we are

that means you can never know when your

grasp might be slipping I'm not

convinced that's it though

or maybe deep down somewhere inside you

understand what's happening to you and

no I am I don't know which scares me

more look I don't want to rush so a lot

of friends whose retirement plans

basically comes down to uploading their

minds into a computer and living forever

in a virtual world they're so sure it's

just around the corner I've never had

the heart to tell them it's impossible

that the human brain is a wet mess of

analog signal interpretation that is as

far removed from the clean logics of

digital processing as it's possible to

be we've tricked ourselves into thinking

that computers and people have anything

in common but no matter how good we may

program them to be at pretending to

think like us that's all we'll ever be

crossing the line from meat and

chemicals into pure digital systems is

impossible and everything else is just

sophisticated programming and illusion I

mean that's fascinating miss winters but

I must politely ask you to start your

statement what do you think I've been

doing traditionally our concerns are

with the particulars of the supernatural

incident its origins and manifestations

I'm giving you context in that case I

still need to make the official

notations statement of Tessa winters

regarding a strange computer program she

downloaded from the Deep Web three

months ago is that accurate

well first off I didn't find it on the

Deep Web

god it's like talking to my grandpa let

me explain something quickly any time

someone tries to give you a line about

the the Deep Web or even better the

darknet chances are they wouldn't know a

VPN from their own ass there's not some

secret sinister underbelly of the

Internet where with the right passwords

and double-talk you can hack your way

into a black market of assassins drug

lords and secret forums it's just that

some websites we need to be a bit more

security minded and need you to use the

right you know software so you're not

monitored I mean yes there's drug stuff

on there but it's mostly just paranoid

geeks who don't want to be caught

pirating Photoshop noted statement

recorded direct from subject 7th January

2017 statement begins have you ever

heard of Sergei Yushchenko I'd guess not

he's one of the less well known online

spook stories and you don't look like

you're a regular presence in the chat

BOTS or neural net communities the story

goes back to about at nineteen

eighty-three during the first home

computer boom

there was this programmer by the name of

Sergei Yushchenko I don't know if that's

his real name

probably not but since a ushanka is a

type of furry Russian hat and he

probably never actually existed but he

was supposed to have been a real digital

guru well according to the story he he

got sick in most versions it's it's

brain cancer but some say early onset

Alzheimer's or some sort of undiagnosed

brain infection point is it was killing

him and it affected his brain

now Sega didn't want to die the idea of

death terrified him and whatever was

eating his mind gave him the idea to try

and save his consciousness to him to

upload his brain well the next bit it

depends on how ghoulish a version of the

story you're told in some he spends a

fortune in every last hour

his last month's trying desperately to

code his own mind into his system and he

ends up lying dead at the keyboard

decomposing fingers still tapping away

the last slivers of himself

other versions get a bit more grotesque

handwritten code in his own blood

feeding into the machine I even heard

one where he took the direct approach

removed the casing of his computer

carved off the top of his skull and used

the last ounces of his strength to

impossibly shove his own deceased brain

right into the circuitry whatever

version you're told the story goes that

it actually works and the police found a

pile of floppy disks full of impossible

code next to the mutilated body of

Sergey Schenker I'm sure you can guess

the next bit first on floppy disks then

later on CD and eventually downloaded

directly Sergei Yushchenko has been a

running prank for people who like to

code text passes and chat BOTS they're

not unlike screamer videos just a lot

slower and ideally subtler you create a

program which appears to be a chat

window with a stranger who identifies

themselves as Sergei the responses

should be as naturalistic as possible to

begin with and in the best ones it's

hard to tell if you're talking to a bot

for the first minute or two but then the

responses start to break down become

more sinister and keep referring to how

much pain Sergey is in eventually the

only response the BOK gives you is

screaming and pleas to be released the

idea is that the chat bot is Sergei your

Shanker's mind and he doesn't like being

in a computer nearly as much as he'd

hoped if it's well executed it can be

genuinely quite unsettling the only two

consistent details across all of them

are a particular image of a heavily

pixelated screaming face and the phrase

the angles cut me when I try to think

which marks the start of the bots

descent into madness well as far as I

know these two things have been

consistent right back to the earliest

versions of Sergei Yushchenko like I say

it's quite a niche legend but within

certain communities everyone's tried

their hand at making a sergei Yushchenko

at least once or even I looked into it

once or twice and I'm

on the fringes I've done a few projects

with basic neural nets but I've never

really tried my hand at a chatbot and

gave up after a couple of hours I used

to love them the whole thing really hit

my sweet spot between creepy and nerdy

and if I found myself about 4:00 in the

morning after watching too many YouTube

ghost videos I'd often go on the hunt

for a new one so when I got a

notification from the bot group I'm part

of and it was just a link to a file

named your Shanker's despair dot exe I

didn't hesitate I downloaded it almost

immediately it was a bit disappointing

to see it was a tiny file or barely over

a megabyte that didn't bode well for the

experience but I was still keen to give

it a go later that night when the

ambience was better I looked back at the

post and saw that underneath it was

comment after comment telling the opie

that they posted a broken link I

shrugged it off at the time but looking

back I think I was probably the first

person to click it and the only one it

worked for just unlucky I guess I forgot

about it for a while

but I didn't have anything scheduled for

the next day so I spent most of the

evening drinking and messing about

online it was about 2:00 in the morning

when I remembered what I had waiting in

my downloads I looked out the dark empty

street below and a pleasing shiver run

up my spine I decided I was in the

perfect mood to have a chat with Sergey

a chancre opening the program brought up

a chat window

it wasn't like most of the others I'd

seen it looked closer to an old-school

text adventure with just a flashing line

to indicate where to type your text

white on back aside from that the window

was empty I wasn't exactly sure what to

do as usually the bots would make the

first move so I decided to go with a

generic hello there was no way the bots

didn't have a response program for that

I waited but there didn't seem to be any

response that was fine often these

things were programmed with waiting

times to give the impression of thinking

or composing a response after about 15

seconds

I'm about to give it up as

non-functional and close it when the

answer comes it's gibberish

just a mess of symbols and letters like

it was using the wrong characters well

some of them weren't even ASCII I didn't

have time to really process it though as

they were generating quickly and soon

filled the whole screen they weren't

static either but changing and scrolling

in them and it's gonna sound weird and

it was only for a moment but I could

have sworn I saw some of the symbols

twitch like they were in pain I was

making my eyes hurt to watch and I

started to feel dizzy but I couldn't

bring myself to look away even then I

thought I was just looking at a very

well-done horror set piece especially

when I started to notice a handful of

English words popping into the wall of

shifting text for a second or two at

time one of them read help help help all

run together and another it peels my

mind like knives my mouth was dry and my

hand was shaking

but even then all I could think was how

could this was I was genuinely impressed

by how unsettled it was making me it was

the laptops fan that finally got me I

gradually realized that it wasn't making

its normal whirring sounds anymore it

had changed her something harsher less

healthy sounding like it was desperately

trying to expel air it sounded like

someone breathing out diseased lungs

pushing and straining and and never

stopping to take anything back in it was

only at that point that the possibility

of malware really occurred to me I

didn't know how it would make my laptop

fans sound like that but my computer

wasn't acting right I tried to exit the

program and predictably enough it

wouldn't close so I crashed it planning

to have a look through in safe mode

sure enough the lights went dark and the

groaning sounds of the fan died but the

white text on the screen wasn't going

anywhere

now that I knew was impossible or maybe

there might have been some way to keep

it frozen on the screen when the

computer turned off but to have it keep

changing and morphing when there was

clearly no power running through it well

if it's possible I don't know how you do

it more words popped in and out of

existence you wanted to talk and

hihihihihi over and over again then all

at once the screen was filled with an

image it was grainy like a very early

webcam the camera appeared to be lying

on a table looking up at a bolding man

he appeared to be in his late 30s I

thought and was shirtless with a face

frozen in pain or distress then he moved

and I realized that I must be watching a

video file the man was crying there was

no sound but I could see great heaving

sobs that sent his whole body shuddering

he stared into a computer monitor the

edge of which I could just about see he

seemed to be sat in the dark and his

face was solely illuminated by the

screen in front of him I watched with

mounting dread as the video continued he

reached down to what I assumed would

have been the keyboard but he didn't

seem to be typing instead there was a

sudden jerking motion and he raised his

hand to reveal one of the keys that he

had apparently torn off he brought it to

his mouth and began to eat it I could

just about make out the snap of his jaw

as the hard plastic shattered between

his teeth

and as he reached for the next one I

could see a trickle of blood from his

lips well that was more than enough for

me I slammed the laptop shut and pushed

it away I decided that whatever was

happening could wait until daylight I

turned on all the lights in my room and

sat in an armchair drinking until I

passed out trying not to think about

Sergey you Shanker I don't know how long

I slept for but it can't have been more

than an hour or two since it was still

fully dark when I was woken by a

snapping crunching noise I opened my

eyes to see my TV screen on it was

showing that same video the washed out

grainy blue making details almost

impossible to distinguish but there was

noise now coming through my speakers I

heard him crunching and eating the keys

as he snapped them off one by one I

tried to figure out how the program

could have jumped from my laptop to my

TV which wasn't plugged in or networked

to it the only thing they had in common

was the Rooter and and that didn't make

any sense not unless someone was playing

a really elaborate really horrible prank

on me specifically and I'm not the

nicest person but I've never pissed

anyone off that much all the time I was

trying to figure this out the video kept

playing the man's breathing was labored

and painful and he was talking muttering

to himself or maybe to me there was no

way to tell

I couldn't make help much through the

mess he'd made of his mouth and what I

could hear I didn't understand he was

talking about how it feels like thinking

through cheese wire and there's no

feeling

but the no feeling hurts and that it's

cold without blood he said that a lot

it's cold and it hurts

he spoke with a Russian accent at one

point he stopped pulling at the keyboard

and reached out in front of him to where

the monitor would be there was a sound

of breaking and he pulled back a shard

of glass I don't need to tell you what

he did with it the worst thing was even

though this meant the screen must have

been shattered

somehow it was still illuminating his

face I unplugged everything the TV the

Rooter the speaker's everything well

that seemed to stop it at least at least

for a while I was in a bad way by this

point and I just left and wandered the

streets until the Sun came up I didn't

take my phone just well just in case

that video was 17 hours long I know this

because it followed me until I watched

all of it well any time I used a

computer watch TV or look too long a

screen there it was didn't matter if it

was my own or someone else's after a few

minutes whatever I was looking at would

melt away and he'd be back continuing to

slowly painfully eat his computer I

tried to show it to a friend once but he

just looked at me like I was playing

some weird joke only I could see it

apparently

I don't want to be mad I don't think I

am but there's no way really to know is

there after a month of this I finally

sat down and watched it through to the

end it was the longest day of my life

and by the end I felt so very sick I

almost threw up when he smiled finally

he laid down in front of the camera and

said the maze is sharp on my mind the

angles cut me when I tried to think then

he stopped moving I could see the top of

his head then and the back of it seemed

to be missing the picture stayed like

that for about half an hour and then the

video ended I haven't seen it since I

keep thinking about the idea of

uploading your mind into a computer I

said it was impossible I still think

it's impossible in the way we want it to

be I can't stop wondering what it must

be like to try and have thoughts messy

human thoughts trapped in the rigid

digital processes of a computer it must

hurt though not a sort of pain that we

can understand is that enough do you

have what you need think yes I think we

do the way you're looking at me I'm

going to assume you don't know anything

more about this than I do not really I'm

afraid I can talk you through some other

encounters we've recorded with

supposedly haunted computers and I think

one of our post grad students is working

on something about supernatural

manifestations in technology but I don't

think we have anything else like this

yeah I figured I just saw your post and

thought why not and it does feel good to

talk about it you know yes I very much

understand oh well I have you

supplemental it looks like my posting on

a few of the more tech-savvy boards

appealing for statements has worked

while the incident itself seems

ultimately inconsequential

I was able to convince Tessa to have a

look at Gertrude's laptop claiming to

have locked myself out I don't know what

she did something about command lines

and administrative privileges but I now

have access oh sorry didn't mean to

disturb you while you were being

suspicious it's fine

no no I'll catch you when you're not

scheming what nothing

I feel like no what did you say I said

there's no need for the attitude I know

things have been difficult oh they have

have they things have been difficult

you've spent a month staring at that

footage double-checking every moment

timing every tea break looking at me

like a somehow staged it but no you're

right things have been different it just

seems a little too convenient excuse me

I mean the CCTV is so corrupted that the

police can't just use it immediately and

then they happen to finish restoring it

just when I start really digging into

the murder and it was an option why not

clean it up when she first disappeared

I'm talking me started on the lack of

cameras in the archives I know I know

Elijah's whole spiel about signal

degradation and installation issues but

I don't buy it

I mean he got the co2 system put in

enough oh shut up just stop talking I'm

sick of this I'm sick of you we didn't

kill Gertrude and no one wants to kill

you you pompous idiot now listen here no

no you listen for once I was fine in

research happy then do you ask me to be

transferred here and suddenly it's all

monsters and killers and secret passages

oh my and the worst thing the actual

worst thing is that no one here has my

back with any of it Elias doesn't care

Martin just wants a tea party and Sascha

and you you're treating me like I'm

somehow to blame for it all like I

didn't suffer the worst right alongside

you well excuse me if my experiences of

your experiences you I got eaten by

worms because of you well what do you

want you want sympathy you know what

yeah

little bit of basic sympathy would have

been nice shame Prentiss was not my

fault I did not bring her to the iover

you went off the deep end afterwards

didn't you everything went to hell when

you actually needed to be in charge you

just hid down here and played with your

teeth well what would you have me do

anything anything that wasn't turning

into a paranoid lunatic would have been

fine anything that showed you could

actually do your job well alaskan elias

should've fired you weeks ago what after

everything you've pulled you should be

gone but no instead we all get to talk

about how you're feeling because we're

worried about a stalker boss I I can't

do this anymore and quit if you hate it

so much leave your post in the archives

permanently you're firing me

I'm offering you a chance to quit no

notice period I'll even make sure you

get the rest of the month's paycheck

just say the words I'd want to so do it

I

can't

I know I I can't I don't know why can't

I quit I don't know but I don't think I

can fire you either what it's this place

I don't understand

neither do i I'm trying to figure it out

on I've got the shape of it but I'm

sorry Tim truly I am but I cannot and

will not trust you this place isn't

right you see that now I don't know how

or why but there is something very wrong

with the archives I don't know who here

is a victim of it and who is an agent so

what do we do for now I suppose we just

do our jobs I don't want

I suppose I'll see you later I suppose

so

and supplemental
