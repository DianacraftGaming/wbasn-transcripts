Martin Blackwood, Assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute recording. Statement number 0131305. Statement of Judith O'Neill, given May 13th, 2013.

Statement begins.


It's weird the things that land you a job sometimes. I mean, a first from Corpus Christi Cambridge and Master's in biological sciences, you'd think that would be enough to get a decent science job, but as it turns out, the competition 

he stays 

is legitimately ridiculous. And trying to get a position based on my academic record seemed to be a complete waste of time.

Then I applied to the Anglo-Brazilian Amazon Trust, and you know what actually got me the job? I had a 

half blew 

in modern pentathlon 

and another in orienteering from my undergrad days

apparently most of the science positions

would generally apply to you by the sort

of people who pursued academia specifically to avoid ever having to climb up a hill 

and the job required a certain degree of outdoorsmanship. It didn't even matter that I didn't speak Portuguese well 

no back then it was enough that I had the knowledge, fitness, and most importantly, was willing to basically chuck in my entire life in England with no notice to fly off to Brazil for who knows how long

strang how things work out sometimes isn't it 

the job title was technically ecological specimen technician but working with the a BA T was basically nothing like any lab tech job I've ever had before 

for start that wasn't a lab not really 

they built this facility just on the edge of the Caracara ecological station and from a distance you'd think he was just this big wooden hut 

and he kind of was 

just full of incredibly high-tech kit 

it was basically no testing done on site though aside from the computers the visiting researchers used to just make whatever notes or observations or run whatever the models they needed 

basically everything on site was designed for quick storage and processing  any specimens for travel

keeping a lab environment up and running in the middle of the Amazon was never really an option so most of our job was focused on retrieving whatever they wanted 

testing and and making sure that it got to the actual lab intact

wherever that might have been 

I was part of the facility's permanent staff and we were generally hired out by corporations or universities who wanted to use our services for some project or piece of research they were conducting 

my specific job was to head out into the jungle

usually babysitting some weedy wannabe explorers who insisted on coming along

and then snag whatever they needed to retrieve 

could be environmental measurements tree cuttings water samples and even small animals 

that 

we're not legally allowed to take anything bigger than a frog 

it's actually really interesting work although you do start to get a little bored of the same 50 square miles of jungle after you've been doing it for a few years 

and we're very careful to stick to the bits of the jungle we've been assigned as we're right next to the Yanomami indigenous territory 

and accidentally crossing into it ends up being a bit politically complicated and even pretty dangerous if you cross paths with the wrong group

the Yanomami can get pretty territorial

I mean I guess you would be too if you had that many companies trying to illegally strip mine your land 

still it's not usually a problem 

we stay in our area they stay in theirs 

the worst part is the number of dickhead scientists 

you turn up with the same played out Cannibal Holocaust jokes 

it's like sure technically they practice and

though cannibalism 

but it's just the bone ash of their relatives and loved ones 

so you know calm down dr. Livingstone there's no way they'd respect your sweaty-ass long enough to even consider eating you 

anyway 

I'm getting off-topic 

I usually head out with the other specimen Tech 

Fernando Mikado local 

and by local I mean she's from now about 200 miles away

Brazil's pretty big and if there's one thing she's really good on that I'm not it's the weather

I'm pretty hopeless at figuring out what any given day's going to be like and just have to rely on whatever weather 

sign I'm currently losing faith in it

doesn't help that the weather in the Amazon is just plain weird 

with rains coming out of nowhere months before the wind should actually be bringing in the clouds and no one knows why 

but Fernanda she might not know why but somehow she always knew when 

to the point where if she said it might be bad I would just cancel the expedition no further evidence needed 

not that day though 

no that day we had the world's pussiest climate scientists breathing down our necks 

doctor nikos

and asked us 

I mean I read his studies and he did good work sure 

but the way he acted you'd have thought that the oceans were gonna drown us all tomorrow if we didn't get out there 

and how he talked I was like 

I mean Fernanda and I were no strangers to patronizing scientists explaining our jobs back to us 

but dr. Anastos was a whole other level 

he talked to us like we were five-year-olds who just asked him what recycling was

Fernando was certain it was going to rain 

but he checked online and apparently it said it was going to be fine 

besides he had some real big money backing him so we couldn't really push the issue 

in the end we went out into the jungle and even I could tell that the color of the sky through the canopy was bad news

dr. Anastos was looking to measure pollutant and plastic levels in some of the nearby rivers 

the various ecological protection law should mean that they had virtually none of either and he was looking into something to do with pollutant transmission and chemical spread from industrial sites 

if it hadn't been for the standard NDA's they were always getting us to sign I could have already told him the sort of results he was going to get 

he wasn't the first to come here for this kind of work 

but my hands were tied

if you're wondering by the way the answer is pretty damned polluted 

largely due to various illegal mining and logging operations and a land seizure in the area 

the point is we were barely an hour into the track when the skies opened the rain came down thick thick in that way that I've only ever found in the jungle 

where there weren't really droplets it's it's more like the air just turns to water 

visibility went down to nothing immediately and I started to 

talk quickly tiffin and there 

about whether we could make it back or where we might be able to shelter 

the rain was bad but we'd handled worse and we were perfectly calm 

not so much doctor and asked us 

who was clearly panicking 

he shouted at us yelling over the sounds of the rain-soaked jungle that we had to go back before immediately charging off in the wrong direction 

obviously we wanted to leave him to his own stupidity and let the Amazon deal with him 

but we both knew that it just wouldn't be worth the paperwork so we followed it trying to slow his pace long enough to let him know that he was going the wrong way

but either he can hear us, or more likely he wasn't inclined to listen

finally I grabbed his arm pulling him to a stop 

he said something I couldn't make out and pulled back trying to throw off my grip but clearly he hadn't considered I'd be the stronger 

and when my grip held firm he unbalanced himself he shifted his leg trying to keep his footing but slips on the now muddy ground falling and pulling me with him 

I instinctively grabbed Fernanda for support but ended up pulling her down as well 

the three of us tumbling down a short and muddy decline and landing hard in the foliage 

it took a few moments to pull ourselves together

it wasn't a huge fall but I felt strangely disorientated as I clambered to my feet shaking my head in an attempt to dispel some of the fuzziness that had settled over it 

the others clearly felt it too although checking ourselves over it seemed we'd been lucky 

all we had broken was our equipment 

although doctor and asked us entwined about that almost as much as if it had been a bone 

I tried to get my bearings but even though we'd only moved a few meters laterally at most I was finding it really hard to get a solid idea on where we were 

I couldn't figure out exactly which way we had come 

I couldn't get a clear read on the sun through the canopy and clouds

Fernanda wasn't having any better luck with the compasses as they were either broken or something magnetic in the area was messing with them 

they just generally span around and around 

there was at least something resembling a trail there 

not one I recognized

honestly we should have just waited it out until we were overdue at the facility and they sent out a retrieval team 

but that would take almost a full day and I could see in doctor and asked us his eyes that there was no way he was going to wait that long 

so we picked a direction and started walking the trail

when I first saw the structures my instinct was to turn around and go back

from a distance they they looked like

?? shibano ?? 

the huge ring of thatch Drew's the Yanomami place around their settlements for shelter 

it didn't make sense though 

there was no way we'd gone so wildly off course as to end up in the indigenous territory 

absolutely no way

it was something else something about

their construction seemed off 

wrong somehow 

so much so that when Fernando grabbed my arm and urgently whispered that we had to leave I shrugged her off and added forward for a better look 

that was when I noticed how quiet it was

aside from the rain the jungle cacophony had simply stopped 

as I got closer to

the chef-owner it became clear what was wrong with it 

well 

each roof was thatched like normal the stands weren't made of leaves but all kinds of different materials instead 

long strands of plastic shards of rusted metal even oddly shaped hunks of cement 

they run through and around each other like any

thought the texture the color everything about it was different in a way that made my stomach churn 

though I wasn't exactly sure why none of the materials were organic or natural I shared a look with Fernanda 

she didn't say anything but she didn't have to we 

both knew how isolationist the Yanomami tended to be

how resistant they were to any outside influences 

the idea that they would have the desire to build or even the equipment to build something like this was ridiculous 

so what did that leave 

but 

one of the illegal mining operations done it just to antagonize them 

possible I guess but it would have taken a lot of work for basically no reason 

just didn't make sense

dr. Ann asta so didn't know enough about the ANA mommy all their buildings to be unsettled and instead voiced his irritation that we were standing around chatting rather than going for help 

he walked around to one of the gaps in the shibano and headed inside 

by the time either of us noticed he was already gone fernanda and ice crumbled after him desperately hoping that we were good enough communicators to be able to convey apologies to whoever was in there

but the inside was just like the outside and in the worst possible way 

there were no people in there but that's not the same thing as it being empty 

instead there were figures 

from a distance they look like human being 

stunning

impossibly still 

but getting closer

quickly revealed the lie 

it was just the rough shapes cobbled together out of a hundred different pieces of garbage 

a broken metal clotheshorse for a rib cage

a plastic chair leg for an arm 

rusted screws for teeth 

in some cases it looked like someone had gone to a lot of effort to match anatomy with construction 

I saw one with a broken water cooler where its stomach would be in 

another had a pair of oxygen tanks standing in for lungs

they were completely still 

there was something about them that made my mouth dry up and my mind screamed to run 

it didn't feel like they were statues 

it felt like they were choosing not to move

doctor Anastos didn't seem to have the same unease with the situation as me and Fernanda as he examined and prodded the figures with apparent delight 

maybe he thought avant-garde jungle art was just something that happened out there 

I don't know I never got a chance to ask him 

because suddenly he was cooing with delight at something he'd picked up off the ground 

the ground I could now see was simply a half-inch of loose thirds over the top of a massive plastic tarpaulin 

he came over to show us his discovery it was a chunk of concrete that appear to the exact size and shape of a tiny pit viper even down to the detail on his head

the doctor seemed quite taken with it but Fernanda immediately sent something was wrong and stepped back pulling me with her 

what happened then was almost too quick for me to properly follow 

the lifeless concrete Viper spun around opened his mouth and bit doctor and asked us on the wrist 

he screamed but only for a second because after that his throat was full 

he started convulsing as a gray liquid concrete began to pour from his mouth from his nose and his eyes his limbs went rigid and I could see his body starting to swell with it 

I don't know if it was me or Fernanda screaming maybe it was both of us 

but I know it was her first spotted that the detritus figures were no longer choosing to stand still 

I was the last I ever saw of Donny Casa San TAS 

there was never any question of trying to save him 

I don't know how long we ran but it was hours before we felt even remotely safe

the jungle looked normal again and more importantly it sounded normal 

we tried to talk about what we'd seen but after confirming we'd both witness the same thing we realized we didn't actually have anything to say about it

just this white-hot fear here that still hasn't completely gone away 

in the end we crossed paths with a group of real Yanomami tribesmen they were really friendly and once they figured out we were lost they were very happy to return us to a part of the jungle we knew near our facility 

of course we didn't have a good explanation for what happened to doctor and asked us so we lost our jobs pretty much immediately 

but you know what that's fine 

I'm done with the jungle 

there's something in there and I don't know which scares me more

the thought that it's more than just the things we left behind well 

that that's

all it is and we can't escape the ruins of our own future 



------



statement ends 

there's a note here as well 

looks like Gertrude's handwriting 

start of a letter to Dekker thanking him for sending Judith through 

though it doesn't look like it was ever finished or sent 

I assume this is another one he was trying to use to prove the extinction

it certainly has something in it

mankind's trash giving rise to something terrible 

and again fear of the other

inanimate humanoid figures that's all very Stranger isn't it 

it's never simple is it 

sort of surprised peter hasn't

rocked up with some more insights 

found

seen him around for a while actually 

I mean it's not like I miss him but at least he was someone - ah yeah that makes sense right fine 

just me on my lonesome for a while then could be worse

peaceful at least 

I don't miss all the shouting even if it would 

wait excuse me excuse me this area is off-limits to the public sorry you can't be here it's not allowed

oh sorry 

and 

Melanie told me to wait for her here 

oh you you here for Melanie

yeah 

Georgie 

I'm sorry sorry I didn't

realize 

I'm I'm sure she's around here somewhere 

you must be Martin

yeah 

there's Melanie been talking about me

oh um John used to go on about you a lot

no not what wait 

I thought Melanie-Georgie and John-Georgie were same same Georgie 

oh ah so you and John are really talking anymore right

why not 

excuse me 

why aren't you talking

have 

because I think he's going to destroy himself and anyone who lets him get too close and I don't want that to include me or Melanie

maybe he just needs some help

I did help him as much as I safely could but he just carried on anyway I realized if I kept trying it was gonna hurt me more than I was willing to accept 

well

sometimes the helping people hurts sure

but that doesn't mean everything painful

helps sometimes people have problems

that will wreck you long before you can

make a dent in them and some people

don't want help they just want other

people suffering with them John doesn't

want that he doesn't know what he wants

and from the sound of things he's run

out of time to figure it out it's easy

to pass judgment from the outside one

more reason to stay on the outside and

what you think Melanie's worth saving

it's not about worth but yeah she's

actually trying to get well so I'm gonna

help her this place isn't a sickness no

I think it's worse look we're all just

trying to do the right thing maybe life

forces you to make hard decisions but I

can never trust someone who goes around

looking for hard decisions to pay and

what you mean by that jumping on a

grenade is only heroic if you weren't

the one who actually threw it that's not

what's happening okay it's still not

something I want any part of well lucky

for you with fully staffed so hey you

ready Oh what yeah whenever you are who

were you talking to

Oh what was that no one apparently yeah

this place will do that to you come on

sure
