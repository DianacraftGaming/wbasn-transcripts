statement of Jack Barnabas regarding a

short-lived courtship with Agnes Montagu

in the autumn of 2006 original statement

given March 18 2007 audio recording by

jonathan sims head archivist of the

Magnus Institute London statement begins

I knew she wasn't normal I think that's

what originally drew me to her I thought

she was just like me another weirdo cast

off from the world I mean there was no

way I could have known she wasn't human

at least I don't see how she can of

being human not the way we think of it

but she was so beautiful that she she

was tall with long straight auburn hair

and these eyes that when they looked at

you it didn't feel like she was seeing

you so much as was trapping you I never

understood the phrase like a deer in the

headlights until she looked me in the

eyes for the first time I don't know

maybe something in my fight-or-flight

reflex is screwed up because those

weren't the instincts I felt when it

happened I should have run of course I

don't know if you normally leave people

alone in a room when they write their

statements but I can understand you

doing so in my case I'm getting used to

people making polite excuses not to look

at me dolia tried to warn me off daily

rock on Joe had worked in the Canyon

cafe ever since it opened in 1991 and as

soon as I headed back into the kitchen

after I saw her gross montague for the

first time she spotted the look in my

eyes and shook her head she told me she

was trouble that there was something not

right about her I asked for more details

and daily just shrugged said that she'd

been coming into the cafe ever since it

opened and that there was something off

at the time I assumed that she meant

Agnes had been coming in ever since she

was a child as she looked about my age

but looking back I'm not so sure it

wasn't as though we would have made any

difference I was drawn to her in a way I

can't even explain I could never bring

myself to say anything or even make a

sound when her eyes fell on me

I barely had enough wherewithal to

confirm her order even if it was always

the same a large cup of black coffee

with enough room for milk she never

actually put any milk in it she never

even drank it she'd just take it over

and sit there staring out the window

into the street for an hour or so it

wasn't like there was much of a view

just a normal Street an outside

Sheffield city centre that's not much of

a view at all

still she'd sit there staring alone with

her thoughts for about an hour then

stand up and leave I'd go over to clear

away her coffee and it was always

scolding hot it was such a strange

little routine and I would spend time

wondering to myself what she could

possibly be thinking about what was her

life that every Tuesday at 3:00 in the

afternoon she came into the same cafe

and didn't drink a black coffee the way

she always used to order the coffee it

always sounded like she was enjoying it

the order I mean like the phrase one

black coffee with room for milk was a

delightfully novel thing for her to say

in the year and a bit leading up to my

finally talking to her I only ever saw

two occasions when she wasn't sitting

alone the first was when another man

attempted to chat her up at least I

assume that's what he was doing I didn't

recognize him but you can always tell

when someone starts a conversation with

a motive like that he walked over and

started saying something or other cocky

as anything Agnes though I didn't know

her name back then just looked up and

met his eyes I could see him start to

falter sweat began to roll down his

forehead but he kept talking then Agnes

went to stand up it was only a very

small movement but the man started as

though a gun had gone off knocking into

the table and spilling coffee all over

his hand it had been sat there almost 40

minutes but I could see his flesh start

to redden with burns whether they could

have touched it he screamed and suddenly

all eyes were on him

his face went almost the same color as

his burned hand and he shouted something

vague at us about suing us over the

temperature and ran out the door in pain

and embarrassment suffice it to say we

did not hear from his lawyers that was

the day I noticed the slight scorch

marks on the chair Agnes had been sat on

though at the time I didn't connect the

two the other time was about near the

end of October last year I remember

because daddy had been ranting at me

about how impossible it was to get a

decent woman's Halloween costume that

didn't as she put it show a mile of skin

I was making some weak joke about going

as a bedsheet ghost and telling everyone

it was sexy because the ghost was

technically naked when I had looked over

and saw someone else sat at the table

with Agnes she was a short Asian woman

with close cropped hair and a thick

muscular frame I remember being a bit

surprised that she seemed to be just

wearing a tank top

given how cold it was starting to get

but it did show off a rather

intimidating back tattoo of what looks

to be a man read in the fires of hell I

still remember how disconcerting I found

that screaming face contorting in the

agony of inked on fire weirder than all

that though was the fact that Agnes

appeared to be talking to her actually

saying words that weren't in order for

coffee or a thank you her voice was soft

and I couldn't make out any of the words

I mean I know I shouldn't have been

trying to listen I know it's a creepy

thing to do but you don't understand how

momentous an occasion this was to see

this beautiful woman whose name I didn't

know finally talking to another human

being it was incredible the shorter

woman's voice was loud though and she

made no attempt at subtlety in her

conversation she was talking about some

sort of job whether Agnes was going to

be able to do it at first I thought it

was a job interview and then she started

talking about Angus being released from

something Agnes just said something

softly and shook her head she looked sad

an expression I'd never seen on her face

before the other one inside clearly

unhappy with the answer and stood up to

leave

before she went she took out a brown

paper envelope and handed it over said

that she'd give it to her now so she

didn't forget later she called it the

collection it looked like the envelope

might be full of money

Agnes put it in her jacket and returned

to staring out the window

as her intimidating companion left with

a frustrated expression that was the

moment I decided to try and talk to

Agnes seeing her interact with someone

else even in such a weird way unblocked

something in my mind the following

Tuesday when she came in and ordered her

coffee I asked her name she looked at me

in surprise and for a second I felt like

I'd made a terrible mistake but then she

told me very matter-of-factly and then I

asked her out on a date I don't know how

it happened it just tumbled out of my

mouth before I could stop it there was a

moment of absolute silence like everyone

in the place had stopped breathing

though nobody had looked up then Agnes

his face twisted into something I think

was a smile and she said yes a wave of

giddy joy just washed right over me and

she took her coffee and went to our

normal table I could feel de leus

staring at me from the kitchen and I

didn't want to turn around because I

knew exactly the face she'd be making I

was too happy to let her ruin it with

her muttered predictions of disaster it

was only after Agnes had left her on

drunk coffee and headed out to wherever

she went that I realized we'd never made

any actual arrangements

I spent the next day in a funk kicking

myself for having been so stupid

I have Wednesday's off work so there was

plenty of time to mope around the house

feeling sorry for myself about 3:00 in

the afternoon though there was a knock

on the door standing on the other side

was act US she was dressed in a dark

woolen coat and gray scarf and had that

same sort of smile on her face she asked

if I was ready to go I was very much not

I asked her to wait a minute as I ran

back to my room to put on some deodorant

and a clean shirt it was as I was doing

this I noticed kind of an odd smell like

when you turn on an electric heater for

the first time in a while and you get a

whiff of all the burning dust

I looked up and noticed within the

corner of the room where there had been

a spider's web this morning there was

just a faint wisp of smoke it was weird

but I had more important things on my

mind as soon as I was ready I headed out

I asked her what she wanted to do and

she looked at me like I was stupid we

were going to walk in the park she said

he was the only possible thing to do of

course I agreed she was the strangest

person I had ever met but something

about it just charmed me so we went down

to bold Hill Park that nearest one to my

flat and we walked I did most of the

talking as he might have expected I

don't even remember half the things I

said now just a meaningless babble of

thoughts personal details anecdotes how

worried I was boring her but every time

I looked over she had that same

expression on which by then I was pretty

sure was a smile I'd catch her eye and

that feeling would flood through me I I

still don't know quite how to describe

it but whatever it was it was powerful

we sat on a bench as the Sun went down

watching the sky redden and Agnes asked

me a question it was the first time

she'd said anything more than a few

words since we left my flat she asked me

if I had a destiny I don't need to tell

you the question caught me off guard I

don't know if I've given the impression

clearly enough yet being a single guy in

my early thirties still working the

tiller to Sheffield cafe but I don't

really see myself as having much of a

destiny hell I'm not even sure I believe

in destiny I certainly don't believe in

God and I feel that's kind of linked so

I told her this she looked at me with

the same sadness I'd seen on her face

before that must be nice she said and

went back to staring into the sunset

we went out several times after that

each time she'd show up at my door

unannounced and tell me what we were

going to do we went to the park a couple

more times had a meal in an Italian

restaurant where she didn't eat anything

I even went to see a film I remember it

was the prestige and when I asked her

her thoughts on it she just told me she

hadn't been watching God she was so

bizarre the last date was November the

23rd 2006 it was the Thursday and the

chill had really hit it was too cold to

spend an evening in the park to be

honest but Agnes had decided that's what

we had to do so that's what we did she

never seemed to feel the cold we'd

walked in silence for about an hour and

it gotten dark I was about to suggest we

leave as they usually closed the park

after nightfall

I heard Agnes gasp I turned to see her

gripping her chest as though in sudden

pain and she told me we had to go I

followed her as she staggered out of the

pardon over to a phone booth where she

made a panicked call she said something

about a tree falling and that they had

to finish something then she hung up she

leaned on my arm as we walked back to

her flat I'd never been there before but

it was clear she couldn't make it

unassisted the building was old and the

wallpaper of the corridor was a faded

green lily pattern occasionally scarred

with a vivid hole burnt into it as we

approached her door I saw a small group

of people gathered around it waiting I

recognized the woman she had been

talking to several weeks before but the

others were strangers to me they were

all dressed in rough work clothes and

wore severe expressions one of them a

big guy with a shaved head was holding

an unlit Lantern and speaking to the

others in a language that I think was

Spanish or Portuguese another held a bag

that seems to be full of candles while a

third had a clear plastic container

filled with hundreds of tiny spiders

none of them paid me any attention and I

was rapidly feeling like I was falling

into something that I really didn't want

agnus turns to me and apologized told me

goodbye and thank you there was such a

sense of finality to it that I felt like

my heart stopped I should have landed I

should have turned around and walked

back the way I've come accepted that I'd

never see her again instead I did the

stupidest thing I've ever done there

caught up in a series of events that I

didn't understand but that terrified me

and drowning in emotions that I still

can't explain I asked if I could kiss

her without warning she put her hands

either side of my head I realized it was

the first time our skin had ever touched

and I could feel the intense hellish

heat that radiated from inside her but

it was too late she leaned in and kissed

me there are no words to describe the

pain my face erupted in boiling agony as

I felt my skin start to crack and peel

and the heat washed over me erasing all

thoughts in blistering white I felt the

fat in my cheeks liquefy and bubble as I

tried to scream but my lips wouldn't

work I felt at the floor the last memory

I have before waking up in the hospital

was a single tear dropping onto my hand

a tiny sizzling pang of torment that

still somehow managed to come through

when I awoke three days later in the

hospital Agnes was dead the police came

and took my statement but they had

already decided it was a suicide and

when I tried to tell them what had

happened they looked at me like I was

making it all up

at least when they could stand to look

at me at all

the doctors did their best and

repeatedly told me that actually I was

very lucky as whatever fire I had put my

face in should by rights have blinded me

as well it wasn't exactly a comfort I

lost almost everything after that I

never had much to begin with and after I

was let go at the cafe I couldn't afford

to keep my home they didn't even try to

pretend it wasn't because my burned face

would scare away customers I've ended up

living with my father again who has been

understanding about the situation though

even he can't bring himself to me my I

most days the worst part is looking back

I'm still not sure what I would have

done differently or I'd to do it all

again even after everything the police

told me about her death and the hand I I

don't know if I would have had it in me

to resist

I just couldn't avoid being drawn in

like a moth to the flame statement ends

a rather different perspective on the

woman known as Agnes Montagu or Agnes

fielding depending on who you ask

although hardly a reliable account

steeped as it is in messy obsessions and

confusion still if the bold man with the

lantern is as I suspect Diego Molina it

would indicate a link between his

notable obsession with burning and Agnes

who apparently had not inconsiderable

abilities in that area I can't help but

wonder if Arthur Nolan the hives

landlord was one of the other members of

that little group I do not know if they

have a name as such but given the

evidence of organization and the

indications of worship I have started to

refer to them in my notes as the cult of

the lightless flame and I believe they

may also be connected to the ritual

circle found in Scotland by Jason north

I've been as yet unable to find any

other details on them with the

information I have most of the

information here has already been

covered following the account of Agnes's

time in hilltop Road but Martin has been

able to make contact with mr. Barnabas

by email he's apparently been doing much

better in the years since his statement

having received some reasonably

successful plastic surgery he was unable

to provide much more information than

the above but upon Martin's asking if

Agnes had mentioned her childhood at all

he did recall her briefly alluding to

being adopted Tim also got in contact

with Daley acondo who confirmed what we

had suspected the woman known as Agnes

Montague had visited the canyon cafe for

a decade and a half apparently without

aging a day I'm now convinced this is

the same Agnes who grew up in hilltop

Road though exactly what she is or why

she seemed to retain her youth remains a

mystery like everything else around here

still she is dead as is Diego Malina I

can only hope that prevents them from

causing further problems

End recording.

John there's nothing down there

no that's not true 

I told you what happened

you told me you wandered around in the dark for hours at a time 

shortly after suffering an incredibly traumatic experience 

so you're saying I imagine

it's a possibility 

the other possibilities are something very dangerous down there 

neither makes me particularly inclined to unlock it 

so what do you plan to do about it 

send someone else 

we really don't have the budget for that 

so nothing 

you're just going to leave it 

for now I think that's for the best

please Elias I need to know 

you really think that this will help 

yes 

yes it's getting harder and harder to work down there without being sure what's underneath me 

so either give me the key or find a new Archivist 

oh good lord

don't be so dramatic John you know how hard it would be to replace you 

I I don't actually but thank you I suppose

I'll have a copy made for you on one condition

be careful 

no more impetuous subterranean adventures 

understand 

of course 

understood 

and for God's sake get some sleep
