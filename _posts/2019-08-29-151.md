oh hello sorry you can't actually be

here I'm not too worried I seem to be

doing alright so far no I mean this area

is actually golfs limits to the public

so and quite right to goodness the

things they could learn here turn your

hair why do they best to keep them out I

say who are you did Peter send you you

must be Martin goodness he was not

exaggerating what's that supposed to

mean I'll come now don't be like that

let's start over Simon Simon Fairchild

Peter asked me to look in on you and

have a small chat well a big chat really

answer all those nagging questions

Simon Fairchild wait

Simon Fairchild as in as in all those

people who said I did horrible things to

them and their loved ones yes they're

happenin haven't they I'd hate to think

I'm under represented in here not when

Peter tells me that that own fellow has

at least half a dozen no no no not at

all

you've sent plenty of people our way

brilliant so shall we get started

sorry I'm still not entirely clear

what's going on what are you doing here

I see I suppose it was a bit much to

expect him to filled you in on

everything already I mean in many ways

that's the point right so you've been

working with Peter for a while now

correct sure and he's been promising you

answers to all those difficult questions

I mean sort of

well that's me what yes well you have to

understand how it is with Peter he finds

talking to people directly very

difficult especially explaining Amorim

esoteric side of things

charming chap I'm sure you agree

absolutely lovely

but even if you can convince him to

actually give you a straight answer he's

just not that good at actually putting

these things into words something to do

with his upbringing I think I'm pretty

sure he was home-schooled you know so

what he sends you to answer questions

because he doesn't want to precisely and

you do it why is that your first

question is there a limit only until I

get bored and that does tend to come

more quickly these days okay okay then

sure sure first question then why are

you helping petered don't you serve

different you know fears well now see

that's actually two questions the answer

to the first is simple I lost a bet and

this is how the good captain chooses to

use that the second is sort of I mean

yes if you want to get technical he

serves the one alone and I serve the

falling Titan but those two are a lot

closer than you might imagine after all

the larger the space you find yourself

alone in the more isolated you feel and

being aware of how lonely you are can

make anywhere feel more empty exactly

I've actually been toying with the idea

of trying to do something with the scale

of humanity itself you know emphasize

all that overpopulation nonsense but

honestly it just doesn't ring true for

me we're all just so tiny and pointless

you see it's hard to really get past it

all so I worry it might be straying into

territory that emboldened our potential

new rival the extinction the very same

Peter said you'd have a lot of questions

about that one I do how a new powers

born hmm don't know how soon could its

attempt this ritual no clue how do we

stop hit aren't help you could you at

least try no no no you're right of

course

the thing you have to remember is that

no one actually knows how these things

work not really there's always been

plenty of theories of course and over a

century or two you dude start to get an

intuitive feel for it but

there's really no hard and fast rules

the powers or entities or fears or

whatever you want to call them are bound

up in emotion in feeling how they exist

what they can do how they interact with

the world it all makes about as much

logical sense as a nightmare which is to

say there is a certain sort of emotional

logic to it all things feel like they

flow together in a way that makes sense

but if you try to stop and do the maths

then it all comes apart at least in my

experience when is a new power born well

when does it feel like it's birth would

be right when enough creatures suffer a

terror of it that feels distinct that

deals truly its own then it would

probably feel right for it to emerge

into its own or perhaps there's a ritual

if it feels right to enact some sort of

birthing Sarah me some ecliptic Midway

and how close is it do you think card to

be sure Peter thinks very close indeed

what with all the current hover I'm

inclined to agree

you don't sound worried that's because

we disagree on exactly how bad it will

be Peter seems convinced that the

extinction is different that it's actual

birth will be as bad or worse as another

powerfully manifesting he believes it's

Advent will be heralded by all sorts of

disasters and catastrophes and global

upheavals and what that kind of thing

sounded like a rich feeding ground well

exactly Peter however seems to think

that it will upset the balance that we

all have an awful lot invested in and

he's not at all certain the world as we

understand will come out the other side

and let me guess you think he can't see

the big picture

I see why he likes you it's all a matter

of perspective you see my patron has

gifted me with quite frankly an absurdly

long life an appropriate gift and one

that serves to provide a certain

distance from things of course a paltry

few centuries there's nothing really but

it's more than most yet and even in that

brief time I've seen all sorts of ebbs

and flows to balance of things do you

know when the last withdrawal I

attempted was I I don't know that Space

Station oh no that's the future my boy

no

it was 1853 the height of the aquarium

mania all over the Empire people were

starting to understand the depths of the

terrible unknown below the ocean and I

thought that was a rich vein to be tempt

even bothered old Harley into helping me

design a special diving bell for the

ritual I called it the awful deep and

between you and me I was rather proud of

myself

so why didn't it work because it wasn't

a very good idea

the fear wasn't out there not like I

hoped it was all sort of fizzled also a

hunter broke in and destroyed the

mechanism sent me and all my sacrifices

plummeting to the bottom of the ocean I

don't see your point my point is you

know I've quite forgotten hey I've just

not been doing much recently it's not a

good time for perspective you see the

world all feels too small these days I

used to do a lot for the religion but

it's just not got the same conceptual

scope that used to honestly I'm pinning

most of my long-term hopes on space but

that's at least a hundred years away

assuming the extinction doesn't derail

everything which is why I'm happy

helping Peter but if it does then I'll

either be dead which will be fine or

I'll adjust it doesn't scare you Martin

taken on a cosmic scale we've never even

been alive what in any way that might

register I mean if this dreadful little

planet had a fractionally different

orbit and life had never even started

here then ultimately nothing of any real

importance would have changed I think

our experience of the universe has value

even if it disappears forever what a

lonely way to look at things which makes

sense I suppose so what do you do then

if if the world is pointless and your

God is so weak right now I have a good

time and do my best to avoid the drama

it's all been getting a bit much over

the last few decades I blame the number

of people from our own numbers point of

view it's getting very busy more Minds

equals more fear after all I thought you

said that the maths doesn't work oh you

are a quick one so maybe I'm wrong

crucially I suspect a lot of the other

servants and creatures out there have a

similar idea probably while they're all

in such a rush to make their own

attempts you make it sound like the

entities don't even know what they're

doing I have no idea if they're doing

anything at all if they're even capable

of doing things I know that most of

their servants are simply doing their

best to interpret and serve something

that is almost definitively

inconceivable you can't be serious

all right let's try one of those

analogies Peter finds so annoying

imagine you are deaf but every night you

hear the most beautiful music in your

dreams and your every waking thought is

consumed by trying to reproduce that

music oh you're mute as well in this

analogy or at least you can't sing and

you need to invent the idea of a musical

instrument from scratch everyone else is

also deaf and mute and yes I think I get

it yes well the point is most of us are

trying so desperately to recreate our

own dream symphony that we bring an

awful lot of our own baggage into the

mix what about the monsters what

monsters things like and the distortion

I thought they were part of the entities

themselves extensions surely they know

what's going on honestly I think they

have it a lot worse than we do imagine

being a hand that can conceive of itself

having impulses shot through you being

moved and clinched by some unseen mind

but never knowing the reasoning behind

your own actions or even if you're just

some thoughtless reflex sounds horrid so

if no one's ever actually communicated

with their patron how do you know they

even want rituals how does anyone know

if they could ever even work we don't

and honestly the idea that this is all

some grand cosmic joke thousands of us

running around spreading horror and

sabotaging each other pointlessly while

these impossible unknowable things don't

work out they're feeding off the misery

we caused

or in that interpretation quite

appealing but I still hear the music in

my dreams who are you

no no who were you originally no one you

would have heard of no great historical

figure or atrocity monger

I've been Simon Fairchild about them 80

or 90 years maybe the business purpose

is mainly by which I mean I was bored

and not being wealthy so I made some

arrangements and sent mr. Fairchild on a

very long fall I could go into details

but without a certain amount of

knowledge of 1930s tax practices it

wouldn't mean very much to you and how

did you get started with it all did she

did did she just look up at the sky one

day and fall head-over-heels in love

sort of actually except wasn't the

actual sky it was a painting that was

apprenticed you see um that didn't

direct no dreadful man but a decent

artist he was fascinated you see with

the human figure he found most of the

rest of the work dreadfully dull so he'd

always delegated a lot of it to us he

had a particular distaste for painting

the sky and I was always the one he

caught on to do them days weeks how it's

been focusing so intently on these

patches of clear sky or swirling cloud

at the top of his latest self-proclaimed

the masterpiece and gradually it sort of

them drew me in until it seemed to dwarf

the rest of the work every stroke of the

brush felt larger than my entire

existence and when I finally lost my

footing well

I should have course a fallen to the

floor of the church broken my neck blue

painted sky welcomed me with open arms

and I never looked back I tried to share

it with others not just as sacrifices

but they often find it difficult to keep

up with the velocity I tend to live at

they tend to get left behind and I

suppose it doesn't help that I can't

bring myself to see any of them as

anything other than trivial hmm they

wonder I'm so sympathetic to the lonely

you know this really is a place for

self-discovery isn't it

statement ends I suppose I'm sorry oh

nothing just my own hubris I should have

known when I came here I said to myself

Simon that I said you're going to answer

this young man's questions but you're

not going to give the watcher a

statement you're better than that but

it's a hard one to resist isn't it you

get in the flow of talking about

yourself and it all just tumbles out

seem like it we're not sit back down oh

I like it you said you were here to

answer my questions for Peter but so far

you taught me basically nothing of any

use the big answers are rarely helpful

then let's try some smaller ones is

Peter attempting a ritual not in the

sense that you're used to him and his

family made their play a few years ago

and they failed I'm sure he'd like me to

explain it but I think he can do that

one himself how honest has he been with

me about which part protecting the

others I think he tried I suspect he may

have slightly exaggerated his abilities

when you first made the deal with his

certainly expended a reasonable amount

of influence and resources to follow

through but that was never the endgame

was it he just wanted me on side long

enough to rope me into his his plans for

the extinction do you really need me to

answer that well fine

so why me what's his plan why not get

the others involved he is what he is

Martin

for a creature of the lonely the urge is

always to isolate never to communicate

or connect I suspect that's why he's so

keen on wages it allows him a framework

for cooperation that doesn't risk any

sort of intimacy as for his plan I don't

know the details but I believe there's

something in the Institute that he

thinks can help his cause and he needs

me to use it presumably from what he

said it must be powerfully aligned to

the watcher if he wishes to use it it

would need someone already touched by

the eye and if he wants to control that

someone they need to serve the lonely

quite right anything else how do you

feel about this you might need to be a

tad more specific all of it

Peters plan that the extinction me I

think I think Peter is taking a rather

large but calculated gamble not just on

you but on a lot of things if it works

he'll be in a very strong position and

if he fails it won't be all that bad you

don't think it'll be the end of the

world

oh it very well might be but life has

continued through dozens of apocalypse

is already ice ages pandemics calamities

extinctions the only reason this one

feels special is because will it's

happening to you and that's the sort of

solipsism that tends to come with

loneliness in my experience so my

feeling is that I'll help out where I

can but ultimately if this Armageddon

comes off then so be it

either billions suffer and life goes on

or billions suffer and life doesn't in

the grand scheme of things it's all much

of a muchness right

sorry too big picture I get that a lot

no it's thank you

this has actually been quite helpful

I'd say any time but honestly if you see

me again

I may just throw you off something for a

joke how do you feel about roller

coasters neutral you're no fun

who was that basura please don't have

don't Sarah let go I don't think so

three weeks I've been waiting to catch

sight of you and now I find you chatting

with Simon Fairchild no you're not

pulling your little vanishing act on me

how did you know yeah John's not the

only one who listens to statements it's

none of your business

no because it seems to me like you're

panning around are two very dangerous

people right around the time your kind

all of us out that makes me worried it

makes me suspicious tell me I'm wrong

you're wrong so what's going on then

talk to me it's complicated

what they're just here out of the

goodness of their hearts helping you

save the world from extinction

you know about that yep John found the

tapes you made for MIT Shh found a stash

of them awhile ago I made sure he shared

with the club there you go then John may

be going through a hole we have to trust

Martin thing but I'm not as far as I can

see you're either compromised or you're

being played and I want to know which I

didn't know John had listened to them

already well he has he seems to think

you'll come to him when you need him I

think you're feeding him what he needs

to hear so he doesn't bother you look I

don't have time for this I don't like

that I have to work with Peter any more

than you do and I didn't know that Simon

was involved until today but I would

hope that you and John understood the

importance of preventing an apocalypse I

guess I'm just a bit burned out on the

end of the world

yeah well that's your problem

if you really think this whole

extinction thing is it why not come to

us for help

I can't Peter's the one with the plan

and it needs me to be alone and you

don't see anything suspicious about that

course I do

but it might be the only way and so far

at least he's been honest with me awful

but honest I need to do this for

everyone you're not expecting to come

out of this are you I'll do what I have

to if I'm right no one else needs to get

hurt okay you want to do whatever grand

sacrifice you think is going to save

everyone go ahead but you'd best be sure

you're not just playing their game I

know what I'm doing

we'll see don't make me regret this

yeah don't tell John please fine I can't

promise you I just know it though how is

he hungry but he's keeping it together

that's good can I go now

sure
