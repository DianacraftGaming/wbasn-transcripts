say it again please excuse me what you

just said can you say it again so I have

it on tape oh okay Jane Prentice is dead

you're sure completely yeah

what's the incineration and there were

no complications

like what surviving worms that escaped

movement from the body during

incineration noises from it like screams

or chanting weird feelings like a

thousand tiny crawling things are moving

across your skin Wow no nothing like

that

just the smell but I mean I'll get to

that it went well nothing left but the

ashes are gave to your friend which I

shouldn't have by the way so keep it to

yourself of course and thank you

sure it's been months though why are you

just looking to make your statement now

it's not really it's not just burning

her body was also the one that was first

called in to deal with the nest in her

old apartment oh yeah but there are a

few things I've been thinking about

putting some pieces together and I

thought well you guys should probably

know right well start from the beginning

whenever you feel comfortable statement

of Jordan Kennedy regarding several

weird things I've found while working in

pest control statement taken direct from

subject 3rd November 2016 statement

begins I've worked as an exterminator

for the better part of 10 years now I

should say pest control oh really

the BP CA generally advised against

using the e word they feel it sounds a

bit too unpleasant harms our public

image I've never really minded I mean I

guess I could say killing things is sort

of exerting control over them but I've

always felt that trying to sanitize my

job is somehow a bit dishonest like

trying to help people forget that what

they're actually doing is commissioning

the deaths of creatures which we've

deemed too disgusting or unhealthy to

live it needs doing don't get me wrong

and I'm happy enough to do it

but it isn't my job

to hold people's hands and make them

feel better about it I've done places

all over London mainly big commercial

buildings where I have to work at night

while all the bankers and the like have

gone home setting traps put down

poisoned boxes the usual residential

homes don't call me out quite as much

for rats and mice especially if it's a

rental place most landlords don't bother

paying out for that sort of thing or try

to deal with it themselves get a lot of

course about bedbugs though those little

bastards are devil to get rid of and of

course come summer we have to deal with

plenty of wasps nests sprinkle in a

generous handful of cockroaches ants and

occasionally even Birds of foxes and you

have a pretty good idea of what my

working life consists of pretty normal

got my first weird call about five years

ago it was ants or so I was told

down in Bromley the house itself look

like a pretty standard suburban home

maybe a bit more rundown than its

neighbours but nothing particularly

unusual about that especially if they

were calling me in there was no car in

the driveway and the blinds were all

drawn despite the summer Sun it didn't

look like there was anyone home I've

found out later that it had actually

been one of the neighbors that called me

in her a woman named Laura Starr but at

that point I was still expecting to be

met by someone at the house and knocked

on the door but obviously there was no

answer now I always wear gloves when I'm

on the job and when I noticed my hand I

noticed a very faint machine where the

thin leather touched the wood it seemed

to be some sort of oily residue I was

feeling less comfortable with the job by

the second I couldn't hear anything from

inside so I knocked again the woman who

hired me had said to let myself in but I

didn't want to just waltz in unannounced

after a few seconds of silence I tried

the handle and sure enough the door

opened there were no lice on the inside

and the place seemed almost completely

empty of furniture

I could see faint movement on the wooden

floor as I looked around for the light

switch

I found it quickly enough and flicked it

on to reveal exactly what I'd expected

and I just hadn't expected that many and

there were so very many of them

to this day I have never seen more ants

inside a building at once there must

have been thousands carpeting the floor

and swarming over the walls

I drew my hand back from the light

switch as I noticed dozens of them

crawling around it even the bulb seemed

to be covered with them causing the

light in the room to be covered with

twitching shadow the house itself didn't

look much better

wherever there was a gap in the end so I

could see that same oily rot and I

couldn't escape the idea that the

building was somehow thick now I've seen

plenty of disgusting things in this job

but I reckon that moment was one of the

most intense I fled briefly back to my

van to decide on my next move normally

hard leave out some poison Bay for them

to take back to their colony eliminating

the problem at its source but an

infestation that bad well that doesn't

come from nothing I needed to get a

sense of exactly what I was dealing with

even from the road I could see a steady

stream flowing out the open door and

over the step I kicked it up with

pesticide spray and headed in for a

closer look I wouldn't normally bother

using spray and ants but this wasn't

normal and formula I was using works and

ants just fun they said I didn't

actually see any of them died I wouldn't

have expected to immediately anyway and

what was important is that wherever I

sprayed they fled clearing a path of

discolored floor for me to walk it was

slow going but I got through most of the

ground floor like that and didn't see

anything except more ants no people no

furniture and nothing at least until I

reached the kitchen and saw the fridge

there was nothing else in that kitchen

even the sink had been removed leaving

just the water pipe sticking out of the

wall like rusty diseased bones but up

against the far wall stood an old fridge

it's once white skin was now a jaundice

yellow and I couldn't quite shake the

feeling that it was pulsing ever so

gently

thick black massive ants swarmed from

the crack in his door and I had no doubt

that whatever was at the heart of this

incredibly unpleasant situation he was

going to be in that fridge so I decided

it was probably a good idea to step

outside for a cigarette before I opened

it the air outside seemed much fresher

as I left the house I walked a few yards

away from the door so that I wasn't too

close and then I lit up it was as I took

the first track that I saw a car pull up

to the driveway it was a small red

compact and the license plate seemed to

indicate that it had only been bought

the year before but even so I could see

the rusts time to bubble the paint near

the edges of the paneling I watched as

the door opened and a man stepped out he

was tall maybe six and a half feet but

it was hard to be sure of his shape

inside the huge brown suit he was

wearing he took one look at me then the

sign on the side of my van that read

Kennedy pest control and his face began

to crease with rage I took another drag

on my cigarette I was uneasy about the

whole situation was waiting to see what

the strange looking man would do he

walked up to me great strides that

brought him close enough that I could

see the unhealthy gloss of sweat on his

skin with everything here sick he leaned

in far closer than I was comfortable

with and demanded to know what I was

doing I told him that the homeowner had

hired me to take care of an ant

infestation and I'd been doing a

preliminary sweep he started to shake

his head violently saying that he was

the homeowner

this was his house and I had no business

being there

well that's why his exact words what he

actually said was that I had no business

applying my vile trade on his property I

was about to get out my phone and call

the one who hired me when his hand shot

out without warning and grabbed me by

the throat he lifted me off my feet with

a strength that terrified me and I was

very glad that even with the hood down

my protective suit kept my neck covered

I could feel his hand through the thick

plastic it was hot like he was running

some incredibly high fever and I started

to panic

he held me there well mr. foot off the

ground and my vision began to swim as he

squeezed my throat as I struggle for

breath I flailed for something to fight

him off with and realize that was still

holding my lighter with the degree of

composure but looking back on it now

still surprises me I flicked the lighter

on and raised it to just below his arm

the result was a lot more dramatic than

I expected

his loose brown suit sleeve caught

almost immediately and within a few

moments his whole arm was alight he

helped and dropped me onto the ground as

he began to flail about trying to stop

the fire spreading further across his

body I stack it to my fan but then it

didn't matter who the rightful owner of

that house was I was done with that job

it was as I was climbing into the fan

that I smelled it it's the most

disgusting thing I have ever encountered

halfway between songket roadkill stale

sweat and rotten eggs with just a hint

of burning rubber and underneath it all

is that undefinable scent of sickness

you know that smell you get when you

enter a room where someone's been ill

for several days no matter what else it

smells like beneath it all there's that

vague but undeniable with disease that's

what this man smelt like as he

desperately tried to extinguish his

burning flesh I drove away trying not to

gag and I didn't look back I didn't call

the police either as I felt they might

not look too kindly on me saying a man

of light even if he did attack me I

assumed he didn't file a report either

as no one ever turned up to question me

about it so that was the first time I

incurred a smell I see and the other

time was when you burned Jane Prentiss

not just I mean I didn't actually see

her the incineration was the first time

I ever saw her in person but a couple of

years ago

I was called in to deal with the wasps

nest that's what the landlord had called

it on the phone at least apparently it

had injured one of his tenants earlier

that day and I was the first pest

control service he had called it was

free immediately he didn't tell me the

name of the tenant though obviously I

now know who it was he didn't give me

any real

details on the fun but he seemed happy

to pay the emergency call-out charge

sort of bundled up my wasp gear and

headed out to Prospero Road it was a bit

strange to get a call about wasps at

that time here it was late February or

early March I think and still quite cold

still if it was a warm enough building

they could easily be getting active

regardless I made sure to check over the

thick suit are used for that sort of job

to make sure there's no weakness or

damage if they were aggressive enough to

injure someone I wasn't gonna take any

chances the landlord's name was Arthur

Nolan he was a short man with a constant

scalp thinning white hair and a well

shoot cigar it looked like his denim

shirt at once contained quite an

athletic build but it had long since

sailed he looked me up and down as I

left my phone and I saw his mouth twist

briefly in irritation clearly he wasn't

impressed I gave him the usual talk

through what was gonna happen I mean he

nodded absently before pressing the keys

to flap for into my hands and pointing

me towards it if I needed anything he

said he'd be in flat one where I lived I

advised him in the other tenants to stay

out the building while I was dealing

with the wasps but he just grunted and

told me again that you'd be in flat one

the other tenants at apparently already

left I loaded up on the farc MD

insecticide and headed in it was a lot

quieter than I expected by the time I

was outside flat for I would normally

have expected to be hearing the buzzing

sound of wasps but the evening was quiet

I opened the door slowly no sudden

movements that might alarm anything on

the other side but again the flap seemed

to be empty it looked like there'd been

some chaos though with books and clothes

strewn across the floor in a shat TV

screen in the corner

I found the ladder up into the loft

space in the center of the bedroom it

was quite small and climbing and my

bulky suit was tricky but I got up there

still no wasps but it was very dark so I

routed around again until I found the

switch to a single bare bulb the light

was very faint enough to make out a

thick hope he lump up against the far

wall

he certainly didn't look like any watts

nest I'd seen before

I mean the shake was familiar enough but

the texture of the surface was way off

they seemed a lot less paper even would

have been normal and the walls were less

regular going off at odd angles and

making it kind of hard to look away the

whole thing was spongy part with tiny

holes and generally looking very

unhealthy indeed and most disconcerting

of all there was still no wasps none of

this chaser Jabba had to do so I figured

I'd start off like any other wasps nest

and see if it worked

I reached forward staying as far from

this thing as the nozzle would let me a

hand I'd pushed it into one of the

larger holes it sank in with almost no

resistance at all I took a deep breath

and pulled the trigger

spraying the insecticide dust deep into

the mass the effect was immediate the

whole thing started to pulse and spasm

the spongy flesh of it throbbing and

bubbling like some sort of vile putty it

began to grow in size blossoming out and

covering the rest of the nozzle reaching

out from me and then it began to scream

not the sound of air escaping or a

buzzing that sounded like screaming the

weird nest thing was letting out a long

warbling cry of anger and pain I dropped

the pump and was down the ladder so fast

I almost fell into the flat below I

could still hear it as I reached the

door to the corridor after I open only

to be confronted by the face of Arthur

Nolan the landlord staring at me with a

look of disappointment he nodded and

began to walk down the hall I followed

him desperate for answers but he just

ignored my questions about what the hell

was going on whoa what that thing was

and kept walking down the stairs to his

own flat at one point he shook his head

and mumbled something about hoping it

wouldn't get this far but he didn't seem

to be saying it to me as soon as the

door opened I became aware of how

uncomfortably warm flat one was the air

was thick and dry and make my throat

feel a bit scratchy the landlord

continued to ignore my presence and

walked over to an old armchair in the

center of the room as he did so

he started to unbutton his denim sure

more so than anything else that happened

that was the thing that finally stopped

me in confusion I couldn't understand

what he was doing as he sat down his

shirt flapped open and I saw what looked

to be an intricate scar on his chest if

I had to guess what it was I'd have said

it looked like a stylized flame but it

also made me think of a face contorted

in pain time seemed to move slowly as he

reached for the ashtray on the arm of

the chair and picked up a pack of

matches he struck one and without even

looking at me he gently pressed the

small flame to the center of the scar

his flesh caught fire immediately

the flames spreading across his body

like rippling water the armchair caught

then the floor and then I was running

out of the building before the rolling

Inferno covered me as well this time I

didn't drive away I stood there and I

watched it burn until the fire brigade

arrived here it was when the fire hit

that attic space at the top floor where

I knew that awful nest still sat that

was when I smelled it the same grotesque

stench that had come from that oily

fevered man three years before avatar my

didn't really connect the two I was too

busy trying to comprehend what had just

happened and when trucks on the ECDC

showed up to put me in quarantine it

slipped my mind entirely here they were

surprisingly forthcoming about Jane

Francis and what had happened and after

an extensive debriefing they actually

offered me a job

apparently Disease Control and pest

control often go hand in hand and I've

been working for them since most of the

job some in mundane a couple slightly

weird but nothing like those two so why

make your statement now

when I helped incinerate her body I

smelled it again like before to me

awhile to piece the two together but I

thought you should know are you saying

there might be more out there like her

god I hope not

I don't know the man from the ant house

he wasn't like her not at all

but that smell were they burned I think

they're connected somehow and that

scares me yes yes it'd rather scares me

to mr. Kennedy's statement has left me

somewhat rattled while I am always glad

of any further closure to the case of

Jane Prentiss this seems to come with

the rather serious caveat that she might

not have been working alone no that

doesn't sound right

Jane Prentiss or whatever this flesh

hive was that took her does not seem

like the sort of being that would work

well with others the house and Bromley

was torn down last year

but Martin managed to locate the

ownership records it was listed as

belonging to John Amherst the dates

aren't entirely clear as to whether this

was just before or just after he

apparently took charge of ivy Meadows

nursing home but there can be no doubt

that it was the same person all the

ownership records from the ant house

lead to dead ends or deactivated bank

accounts it doesn't sound like he's

another flash live

no connection except disease and insects

and a foul smell when they burn 

Jane Prentiss is dead 

this is a long way from over

Supplemental.

I I don't have much to report, actually.

It's been Halloween week, which means the research department is always inundated with statements.

Most of them are patently false, but the volume means that they've called in the archive to assist with the overflow.

It's been nice, actually

disproving piles of nonsense felt good, like real work, not just driving myself to distraction with conspiracy theories and paranoia. 

I even got a good night's sleep. 

I miss those days.
