statement of Samson kempthorne regarding the workhouse architecture of George Gilbert Scott 

original statement given June 12 1841 

audio recording by Jonathan Sims head archivist of the Magnus Institute London 

statement begins 

dear Jonah 

it is my fondest wish that this message should find you in good health as I have heard more than one mutual acquaintance remark on your current state of overwork 

while I honestly hope it is merely idle gossip my knowledge of your character leads me to entreat that you allow yourself some respite or at the very least take some further secretarial staff into your employ 

certain uncharitable quarters would have it that your life consists of little but rattling around an edinburgh town house 

surrounded by piles of ghostly accounts and lunatic documentation piles 

I am afraid to say to which I am about to make an addition 

I would suggest you come visit with myself and Marianne as a diversion but if you were of a mind to do so you must travel swiftly 

you see we are shortly to depart for New Zealand there to start a new life far from London and its work houses 

and it is this imminent departure that has had such a freeing effect upon my pen 

for there are things I have seen which I feel deserve a place among your Asylum of letters 

they regard the works of my former assistant George Gilbert Scott whose own architectural practice is now most respected 

I have been fearful that accusations of slander my dog me were my tale to be set down 

but with a boat to the new world beckoning and your sterling reputation for discretion I fear it may at last be time to divest myself of the disquieting scenes I have witnessed 

George came to me in 1834 from his engagement with the Office of Henry Roberts where he was completing his training 

Henry himself I have the greatest respect for as he trained on a sir Roberts Merc who had received his knighthood not two years previous

Henry was very effusive about the talents and prospects of young mr. Scott was at great pains to inform me that is a young protege also received certain architectural tutelage is from sir Robert himself 

he said this with the oddest of looks as though there was some jolly secret between us I rather just nodded as if to say I took his meaning and he left well enough alone 

he even showed me George's work on drafting his plans for the fishmongers hall near London Bridge which had opened to great acclaim 

it certainly seemed clear to me that he would make their finest istant 

at least for as long as I were able to keep him

and so we began our brief collaboration the subject of which was the workhouse a topic as I'm sure you recall very close to my heart 

the plight of the poor and destitute has been a national disgrace for far too long and when I was handed the task of designing them by the poor law commissioners it was an undertaking I embarked on with no small amount of zeal 

my original designs were intended to assist in the easy segregation of inmates by sex age or infirmity with capacity and utility foremost in my mind

I know many look on the workhouse with disdain calling it the paupers bastille and seeing very little distinction between the workhouse and the prison 

but this is a deeply myopic view to take 

the prison keeps its population for the safety and improvement of society at large while the workhouse exists the improvement of the inmates themselves 

to criticize the conditions as harsh is to overlook the basic moral imperative of work itself 

and I firmly believe that a dismissed the punitive as a valid form of moral improvement is to consign many a poor soul to perdition 

but I digress

Jonah I am so used to penning defenses of my designs that it seems I can hide little which does not do so 

it was in his assistance with these designs that George first began to show those peculiarities of character that I would become so ill at ease with 

his process redrafting was deeply unsettling 

he would spend hours in the office simply staring at the drawings saying nothing taking no food or drink and ignoring any inquiry or interruption 

then in a single move he would gather up all the papers and retire to his private office locking the door behind him 

then from the other side that firm oak door I would hear the strangest sounds muttering and shout 

it was always in George's voice alone 

I could never quite discern the words 

it often sounded as though he were in some great to distress 

and on more than one occasion I was within minutes of summoning a constable to assist in breaking through the door 

when he would emerge glistening from exertion and holding completely redone drawings 

I'm sure I even saw blood on his collar once

the designs themselves were little better 

he would take the solid functionality of my original plans and we make them in all sorts of odd symmetries 

which while architectural II intriguing generally sacrificed many practical considerations 

he also without fail made everything closer 

passageways would be narrowed and sleeping quarters shrunk until a building designs to hold 300 paupers would be remade to house almost twice that number 

as I mentioned before I have no objection to harsh conditions within the workhouse to dissuade the idol from taking residence there 

but the cramped plans the drawed represent me bordered upon the claustrophobic and I was generally unable to use them 

each time I told him so his face would tighten in momentary anger and his lips would go white 

then I would watch as he took that rage and discarded it once again becoming the genial if somewhat serious young man I had first met 

it was an odd sight 

when his father died in 1834 it came as no great surprise to me that he chose to resign from my service 

he told me he considered it necessary to become the provider for his family 

though I have my suspicions he was also eager to no longer have his designs subject to my scrutiny 

I wished him well naturally but could not honestly say I was not somewhat relieved by his departure 

it was shortly after this I received an invitation to a small social gathering hosted by Henry Roberts 

it was there that I met Sir Robert smirk 

he was a tall man with a sharp almost saturnine features 

an eyes that seemed to regard you in ratios and pounds of raw material

he was polite and garius but I found him difficult to talk to at length as he seemed to be forever further ahead in the conversation than I was 

and I could never be sure whether or not I was boring him

but I realized that George was not present and there was no sign of his imminent arrival I resolved to raise the matter with Sir Robert 

regarding what exactly his tutelage had entailed 

the mention of the name George Gilbert Scott Sir Roberts face flushed suddenly with a anger in a manner  not entirely unlike that of his protege 

he asked me what my interest was in mr. Scott and I told him that he had until recently been engaged as my assistant 

this Robert gave a small laugh of satisfaction and told me I did not realize exactly how lucky an escape I may have had 

I asked again what exactly is training it entailed and Sir Robert stared at me for a silent minute before he finally nodded his head

balanced he told me equilibrium the

hardest thing for an architect to achieve 

symmetry is easy but does not in and of itself result in balance 

to stir the feelings of man to create a small place of being divorced from the rest of the world while still retaining that balance is the true goal of the architect 

I'd never heard my profession talked off with such conviction if I had before 

and I will not lie to you John of the look in his eyes when he spoke scared me 

without prompting his tirade continued and he began to talk about George 

about shortcuts and symmetry and a patron that the young fool did not understand 

I could follow very little of it and it seemed to be decidedly removed from anything that I would consider architecture 

but whatever it was that Sir Robert had been teaching George it appeared the lessons had been put to less noble use than he had intended 

it was at this point that Henry noticed a Roberts agitation from across the room and came over to gently assure him away to the smoking-room 

he sent me a glance of mild reproach as he let his mentor away and I was left standing there in the middle of the room utterly confused and rather shaken 

I resolved to avoid where possible having anything further to do with George and continued with my own works 

I heard he had set himself up with construction of work houses according to his own designs 

he had taken on a partner by the name of William Bonifant Moffatt a builder's son with no moral character to recommend him of any sort 

they vigorously can

first several district Guardians managed

to acquire several Commission's that have previously been mine 

needless to say I was rather taken aback by this utter lack of professional etiquette 

but I was not without other projects so I endeavored to ignore it and leave him to whatever squalid in tournaments he cared to build 

it was in September of 36 that had happened 

shortly after George and Moffat had finally opened the first of their work houses 

I didn't realize that was what had happened until afterwards ensconced as I had been in my own work

darkness had fallen and still I was busy lit by the reassuring glow of a dozen candles

there was no clock in the workshop a deliberate choice to stop the lateness of the hour disturbing me 

but I suspected it would been somewhere past midnight 

when I heard them footsteps

heavy thudding footsteps 

and the click-clack of a sturdy came 

my assistants had locked all the doors when they left the evening and through the silence of my study I could not have missed the sound of them 

opening again

to my dying day Jonah I will avert that no one entered the building before I heard the footsteps approach 

as their heavy tread grew closer and the crack that Cain struck louder with a quiet malice 

I heard another sound beneath them 

the jangle of keys 

I have never in all of my life being possessed by such a fear as I was then

the walls and floor seemed to rise towards me stealing the air from my lungs until I swear that I could feel the splinters from the ceiling digging into the soft skin of my face

I couldn't move 

was the thudding boot tread came to a halt outside the door and the cane came to rest with a final

I waited I waited to have the last vestiges of life squeezed from me by whatever this was 

I don't know how much time passed 

and then though suddenly sloughing off a heavy cloak the weight fell from me the room returned to its natural proportions 

which is to say it never truly changed 

I think it is hard to describe exactly 

Jonas II will

forgive my vagaries 

I rose to my feet and in a moment of foolhardy bravery that I doubt I shall ever truly understand I grabbed a candle and ran to the door flinging it open 

I saw a figure walking away through the door to one of the clerk's offices 

it was short and wide and I could see the wood of the floor bow beneath its huge boots 

it wore a tall black hat and only the finished wisps of gray hair were visible below 

in its coarse ruddy hand it held a hard worn black came tipped with iron 

then the door closed behind it and it was gone I followed into the room behind it but it was empty 

there was no sign of the man or whatever it was that had gone in before me

the window was sealed and there was nowhere for someone of that size to hide

still I searched 

I wasn't sure what else to do 

even the heavy boot print seemed to have vanished 

but I did manage to find however fallen behind one of the writing desks was one of George Gilbert Scott's work house designs 

there is of course no way to be certain of any connection between the two events

but that did little to quell the scolding rage in my breasts

as I strode out of my door the next morning I took a cab to George's office

where I was informed that he was at his work house site with Moffat 

and took another cab 

I found the site in a state of some commotion with my former assistant standing next to a high stone wall arguing with a labourer who seemed quite distraught 

he was gesturing wildly at an area of the wall while another man I assumed to be Moffat tried to calm him down

as I approached I began to make out what the laborer was saying 

he was asking after someone he referred to was the governor 

while Moffat was trying very patiently to explain that no governor had yet been appointed to the workhouse the labor didn't seem to be paying this point much mind 

however he kept repeating that the governor had come to see Harry 

he did not say who Harry was but I assume an acquaintance of his 

he said he knew it was the governor because of the jangle of his keys 

he said that the governor had called Harry idle 

it was at this point I was finally close enough to see the wall he was pointing at with such excitement 

at first I thought there were worms small and pea looking's the brickwork 

but as I got closer I saw them clearly extending from the unblemished solid stone of the workhouse wall 

before fingertips 

the labourer repeated it again the governor had called Harry idle 

I returned to George's documents and left 

I trust you will understand now Jonah why I have been avoiding the company of my fellows these last few years 

I have always been reluctant to make any notation of my story 

but now that I finally have everything prepared for my move to New Zealand I would feel like I had slighted you and I left without sharing my tale

do with it as you will I am done with it

Sincerely Yours

end statement 

obviously trying to trace disappearances and deaths in Victorian work houses is an exercise in futility

so I'm loathe to even fry 

more importantly who is Roberts Merc 

I have read every book I can find on the man

which is admittedly not many 

and none of them show any sign of this other side to him 

apparently at the heart of strange buildings and architecture all over London 

and now what 

students apprentices

if Henry Roberts was a student of some sort of paranormal construction methods it doesn't appear to show up in any of his buildings 

save perhaps for fishmongers hall which he designed along with Sir George Gilbert Scott for the worshipful company of fishmongers in 1834 

it is reportedly a hotbed for low-key hauntings but nothing of the magnitude we've heard from others 

Scott is concerning however 

while smirk seems to have built a handful of notable buildings around London

Sir George Gilbert Scott is responsible for landmarks such as in Pancras station the Albert Memorial and the restoration of Westminster Abbey 

if his buildings have similar quirks then let's be honest I don't know what that would mean but I doubt it would be good 

that said there have been no reports of any sort of paranormal or supernatural disturbance in any still standing building designed by Scott

how should made me feel better

but somehow it doesn't 

end recording
