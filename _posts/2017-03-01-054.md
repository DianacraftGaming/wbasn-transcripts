statement of Alexander scapel horn

regarding his evaluation of the trophy

room taxidermists in Barnet original

statement given June 23rd 2013 audio

recording by Jonathan Sims head

archivist of the Magnus Institute London

statement begins I try not to judge on

appearances I have a certain sympathy

with those who find themselves

instinctively reviled by those about

them not simply because I myself and

what you might generously describe as

odd looking but because my career has

taken me down the path of working for

the Inland Revenue and you should see

the way people were coiled from new when

they find out you work for the taxman so

I tried to have a little bit more depth

than that and give everyone a chance

so was with what could be described as

an aggressively open mind that I made my

way to undertake an inspection of the

trophy room a taxidermist shop near

Woodside Park in Barnet I have never

been in any way attracted to the idea of

taxidermy aside from a few interesting

examples in the Natural History Museum

but I was quite certain it didn't

deserve it's ghoulish reputation of

course I was inspecting it to ensure it

wasn't being used for money laundering

purposes so if it turned out it was

involved in criminal activity I would be

quite justified in any bad opinion I

might care to indulge but I didn't want

to be premature you see the trophy room

had been a staple of Woodside Park for

some thirty years but like many niche

interest shops seemed to see little real

business its taxes were all in order but

there were very few regular customers

and most of the money that kept it in

the black came from occasional large

transactions that seemed somewhat

excessive for the items being purchased

all hallmarks of money laundering you'd

be surprised how many businesses that

you pass every day on the street are

being used in a similar manner those

shops that never seem to be open or who

cater to such a specific market you

wonder how they can break even well

often they can't without some illicit

assistance now I'm not the police I have

no power to arrest anyone revoke any

licenses or even issue a fine

a good deal of hassle that all comes

later and from other people my job is

just to discuss their compliances and

policies to prevent money laundering and

examine their transactions to confirm

that they're not to suspect I find it

fascinating but I am keenly aware that

the majority of the people I inspect do

not share my opinion as soon as I

arrived at the trophy room I could tell

that it was going to take some time the

shop had that layer of grime that only

accumulates after a business has been in

place for decades without change the

painted golden letters were now a dirty

brown and the edges of the olive green

awning was streaked with muck the

stuffed tiger in the window was so faded

by the Sun that I had to do a

double-take to check it wasn't a lion so

faint with the stripes its eyes were

glassy and one of its teeth seemed to

have broken off even so there was

something about the curve of its mouth

that drew me in and I got so lost

looking at it that I quite jumped when

the bell above the door sounded it's

jarring clang I looked up to see a

surprisingly young man standing there I

had expected some crusty old gamekeeper

type judging by the look of the place

but instead this fresh-faced

20-something held out his hand for me to

shake I did so the hand was firm and

very dry I asked him if he was the owner

and he said he was introducing himself

as Daniel Rawlings

apparently the place had belonged to an

old friend of his father's who didn't

have much in the way of family and when

he passed away a few years before Daniel

had inherited it I asked him if he was

even interested in taxidermy and he just

shrugged and gestured me inside the

smell hit me as soon as I crossed the

threshold it was so thick you could

almost taste it like something had

murdered a lily and it was rotting under

the floorboards dreadful smell I tend to

see Daniel lighting a cigarette as if in

acknowledgment of the odor he just

shrugged again and said it was chemicals

casting an eye over the assembled

collection of taxidermied wildlife

it was then I became aware of them

hundreds of glossy dead eyes staring at

me from all directions a huge moose in

front of me a shelf full of squirrels

along the wall unmoving Ravens attached

to an old electric chandelier

and dozens and dozens of fish mounted on

plaques or sealed in fake tanks fur

feathers scalars every manner and type

of dead skin surrounded me each frozen

in uncanny stillness as though they were

trapped in a world where time had simply

stopped everything except their eyes of

course their eyes had never been alive

and they all seemed to stare in my

direction so that to look too close at

any of them was to gaze into that unseen

glass I took a moment to compose myself

and try to remember that I had made a

decision to not judge the shop or its

owner based on the fact that many

consider taxidermy unsettling I could

see myself becoming one of these people

and I fought very hard against the

feeling of wrongness that seemed to be

trying to worm itself into my mind I

forced myself to pay Daniel some big

compliment about the variety of his

pieces as he lit another cigarette

I considered mentioning the smoking ban

but that wasn't really why I was there

so I just started talking about money

laundering instead he nodded and said

he'd had the letter announcing the

inspection and had got all the accounts

and transactions for the past few years

ready for me he explained that as he'd

only taken over the business very

recently he wasn't aware of much in the

way of anti-money laundering policies or

procedures this was music to my ears as

there's very little I enjoy more than

taking an engaged new business owner

through the basics and in a few minutes

I'd have gotten all the glassy eyes that

seemed to follow me around the room at

least mostly Daniel seemed remarkably

interested when I outlined basic checks

and due diligence but it wasn't the

first time people especially new

business owners tend to sit up and take

notice when HMRC turns up for a visit I

mean I try not to exploit my position

but people take a visit from the taxman

very seriously and it can produce some

wonderfully attentive audiences Daniel

didn't seem panicked or worried though

simply intrigued he asked all the right

questions and was always ready with a

good example for any of the more

abstract aspects of the discussion all

in all he was a real pleasure to discuss

money laundering with I'd even stops

noticing the smell after a while

though I'd become aware of it again

whenever he started another cigarette

something that usually happened almost

immediately after he finished his last

one I can't even imagine what his lungs

must have looked like the only thing

there was a touch awkward was that he

seemed determined to avoid eye contact

looking at the floor or the taxidermied

animals but never directly at me it was

a little bit disconcerting but I have a

cousin with autism so it wasn't an

entirely new situation to me eventually

the discussion ended and Daniel talked

through some of the potential policies

he was going to put in place they

actually seemed a bit excessive given

that he was the only person currently

employed at the trophy room but I

certainly wasn't going to tell him to be

less careful and then asked if I could

have a look at his books and he nodded

again and took me through to the

backroom the office behind the main shop

was small and very clean most of the

space was taken up by a large oak desk

and I could see another door leading

through to what seems to be a workshop

judging by the tables and bags of

sawdust

Daniel handed me his account books bank

records and receipts and left me to it

none of it had been digitized and I

could tell it was going to take me a

long time to get through it all the

smell was fainter here though so it

wasn't quite as dreadful as it might

have been there was taxidermy in this

room as well though different to the

ones out front hung along the back walls

were pelts and treated animal skins they

looked very old some I recognised as a

Native American or African in origin and

one seemed so old I was worried to even

breathe in air it in case it collapsed

into dust on top of the desk pressed up

against the wall was a mounted hair in a

small waistcoat it reminded me the white

rabbit from Alice in Wonderland although

its fur was faded and now stained a

faint yellow I found its face a bit more

unsettling than the others though I

couldn't tell you why I tried not to

look too closely at it as I went through

the shops records it didn't look like

there was any money-laundering going on

which was a relief the prices that

people were occasionally paying for the

stuffed creatures were very high but I'm

by no means an expert on the industry

and there didn't seem to be anything

else suspicious in the books

I did wonder the sort of people he was

selling to though from the back room I

watched four customers enter over the

course of the day

in each case I watched as they got more

and more unnerved before finally fleeing

back out the door trying to rationalize

their fear I sympathized it was almost

closing time when Daniel came back to

check on me I gave him the good news he

didn't seem particularly believe it but

told me he was glad to hear it then he

laughed and asked if I knew how honored

I was I didn't understand he told me

that I was sat here among some of the

oldest skin in the world that was how he

phrased it it put me a bit on edge and I

cast a nervous glance towards the

workshop before reminding myself that I

was keeping an open mind about his

strange profession Daniel started to go

through the pieces on display Buffalo

skin from North America Jaguar from the

South a wolf pelt from the early Middle

Ages the hair he said had been part of

the Great Exhibition of 1851 and it

helps drive Victorian England mad for

the craft I didn't like the emphasis he

put on mad when he said that

finally he pointed the oldest of the

pelts he told me it was gorilla skin

from Carthage brought by hanno in the

5th century BC and it might just be the

oldest piece of taxidermy in the world

to be honest I didn't believe him even

if a gorillas hide could be preserved

for more than two millennia it seems an

unlikely thing to be found in the back

of a shop in Barnet it was clearly very

old though and I didn't challenge him on

it I was just about to make my excuses

and go when the bell rang out at the

front of the shop and a pair of

obnoxious cockney voices started to call

out for Daniel his face went blank at

this and he asked me to excuse him one

second abruptly leaving me in the back

room alone I heard the men say something

about unloading a van and then the bell

rang again taking Daniel with it I was

alone I was just packing up and making

some final notes for my report when I

heard something it was muffled but

definitely seemed to be words it sounded

like he was coming from beneath the

floor I looked and saw a ring Paul

connected to a small door I hadn't

noticed

which I assumed led to a basement the

sound came again I cast a look into the

main shop to see if Daniel had returned

it was quiet

I knew opening the door was a stupid

thing to do I can't imagine a single

scenario where it would have ended well

for me but the whole place was so

strange that part of me couldn't resist

seeing how deep the rabbit-hole went if

you're part of the joke so I opened the

door it did indeed have a flight of

stairs disappearing down into what seems

to be a basement if there was a light

switch I couldn't see it it was

impossible to see anything beyond the

first dozen steps or so the light that

filtered through from the dim bulb

behind me did illuminate one thing

though a face I couldn't make out any

details but it was pale and swayed ever

so slightly from side to side the body

below it was shadowed and hidden but it

seems to stare up at me as it moved it

spoke the cadence identical to what I

had heard through the wooden door we've

got one down here come on I'll show you

it was so flat almost mechanical it felt

about as much like genuine speech as the

wind flowing through a cracked Rock

sounds like a flute being played which

is to say they may sound almost

identical but only one of them is made

by a living human

I started to say something to call out

but my voice died in my throat slightly

as the face retreated back into the

basement we've got one down here come on

I'll show you

I turned and walked very briskly into

the main shop I was now fully terrified

and could feel the cold sweat dripping

off my forehead and the doorway stood

Daniel he asked if I was alright with a

smile that made my stomach drop and at

last he looked me in the eyes I

recognized the glassy stare the same

eyes that gazed at me from a hundred

sawdust filled sockets around the room

when they all began to move I nearly

broke down if I had I have no doubt that

I would be dead or maybe far worse

instead I had a sudden rush of

adrenaline and charged into Daniel

knocking him sprawling to the floor in

surprise it was like hitting a sandbag

his - cockney friends were too slow to

grab me before I was off down the road I

may not look it but I can move it a fair

pace when I need to and I did so for

almost an hour before I finally felt

safe enough to stop I was very lucky you

know I had the foresight to gather all

my notes before I opened the basement

door it meant I didn't have to return I

could simply write them up a glowing

report and never think about it again

safer giving you my statement of course

that's exactly what I did after all

whatever all that other stuff was they

weren't laundering money statement ends

it was with some trepidation that I made

the discovery that the trophy room is

still in business and still under

proprietorship of Daniel Rawlings is the

sort of lead we never get in these cases

still active and available for

investigation however given the events

detailed here I had some very serious

reservations about sending anyone to

investigate I may not entirely trust my

assistants but I won't lose them

eventually Sasha volunteered I warned

her it might be dangerous but she did

seem very keen it turned out to be

rather a letdown in the end

sinister as the taxidermy was there was

apparently no figure in the basement

which Rawlings was Happy's let her

investigate nor any obvious weirdness to

any other aspect of the shop

Rawlings denies any memory of

specifically cockney delivery man but

I'm sure I don't need to spell out my

suspicions there there's nothing we can

prove and if he doesn't want to talk

there's precious little we can do to

change his mind he also denies being the

same Daniel Rawlings who disappeared

from Edinburgh in 2006 he allowed Sascha

to take a photograph of him and I've

been comparing the pictures available

for the Daniel Rawlings who disappeared

it's the strangest thing they're

different heights different builds

different shapes to the face but their

hair is identical their eyes on the

other hand are not and I find it hard to

credit that they could be the same

person another dead end and recording

supplemental I broke into Gertrude's

flat I was doing some digging when I

discovered that her home had not yet

been relent a quick discussion with the

agent confirmed that there was some

legal delays due to the manner of her

disappearance and death and she was paid

up for the next six months

so they hadn't yet cleared it out so I

broke him

it wasn't easy in the window meant that

I didn't get a lot of time before I

heard sirens but I think I got away with

it I learned a few things from this

firstly Gertrude lived a very minimalist

existence there was nothing in the

kitchen except teabags a pot kettle in a

single mug her bed was neatly made and

she had a single bookshelf filled with

an array of volumes mostly on history

judging by the bag I found nearby I

think she must have gotten rid of books

once she had read them she didn't own a

television but I did find something that

piqued my interest

a laptop charger

there was no sign of the computer that

went with it but the indication that she

might have owned one has inserted itself

rather high on my priorities list still

her home has given me little information

in of itself though it continues to

prove that my impressions of Gertrude

could hardly have been less accurate I'm

starting to feel like the only correct

assumption I made about her was that she

probably liked tea oh and I looked

through a handful of books on her shelf

they were very well taken care of with

the exception that anytime a person's

face was featured on the cover their

eyes had been cut out and very carefully

removed and supplement
