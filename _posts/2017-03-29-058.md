unsigned statement regarding potential

cannibalism

while attempting to travel the Oregon

Trail original letter dated November the

10th 1845 audio recording by jonathan

sims head archivist of the magnus

institute london statement begins I have

accepted I shall not survive this the

cold bites through my skin and feels as

though it cuts into my very soul and I

am so hungry that I can barely stand but

I shall not give in I can hear him

taunting me still tempting me but I

shall choose to die rather than take

part in such an unholy meal nor shall I

take my own life whatever extremity my

suffering may reach I am certain my

final reward will come soon and I shall

face my Savior with a clear conscience

and a heart full of faith Pastor

Lawrence once told me that there are no

empty bellies in heaven and I am sure

that he is right I wonder if I shall see

Benjamin there I should hope so for all

his faults and his incessant chatter and

together with all those we have lost I

am sure we shall look down upon

perdition and watch Eustace wick

writhing in agony

among the well-earned flames speaking of

flames

I must apologize about the state of the

paper to whoever may be discovering this

message I'm having to write this close

to what fire there is both for light and

to stop the ink from freezing there will

likely be some scorching but I should

hope it remains legible we should never

repeat empted the Oregon Trail I see

that now I should have stayed in

Savannah and built what life I could may

be accepted the proposal of Adam

Hawthorne he was a decade my senior but

I heard no complaints from his previous

wife while she lived and it would have

been a better fate than to freeze to

death in these mountains

listening to Benjamin's incessant

taunting but my life before had been

hardship and travel and

there was a part of my soul that felt

that such a thing was simply my lot so

when my father joined my mother in

heaven not three years after moving us

to the small town of Savannah Missouri

it felt as though moving again was what

the good Lord intended for me it was

then as I had to choose between trying

to scrape a living from 20 acres of

Missouri soil that my father had left me

or Forge out on my own that Benjamin

Carlisle kindly asked permission to

repair his wagon on my land I will not

deny he was a handsome man even now the

cold has preserved that pleasing cast of

his face gaunt though he may be I was

somewhat taken with him but had no

further thoughts about it

being somewhat plain in my own

appearance it took me quite a back when

I brought a jug of water to his fire

that evening and he asked me directly if

there was anywhere in the town of

Savannah where he might find a wife well

this seemed to me something of a strange

request though I myself knew little of

courting Benjamin explained that he was

set to be travelling up out of some

Joseph along the Oregon Trail towards

Willamette Valley a lush paradise of the

frontier the settlers of Oregon country

he said had offered land to those who

might follow 320 acres of land for the

unmarried he said but a married settler

could claim 640 acres that and the

prospect of another pair of hands to

help with the work of farming was a

great incentive all told he said if he

was able to find himself a wife before

he reached Oregon country he very much

intended to do so well after he told me

this I explained my situation to him and

we were married by pastor Lawrence the

following day even now I can't fully

bring myself to regret that part of the

events that led me here and had we

reached the Willamette Valley as planned

I believe we would have been far happier

than most I had few real possessions to

pack and little food left but I took

what I could into Benjamin's wagon it

was late May when we began our trip and

had I known more about the route we were

to take I might have known that this was

dangerously late to be starting such an

expedition but I did not in many ways

Benjamin was as impulsive in his travel

plans as he wasn't using a wife and it

was only after we had been on the road

for some time that I realized how

ill-prepared he

for many of the hardships of the trail I

never asked him exactly where he was

from or why he wished to settle in

Oregon those few times I broached the

subject he would talk all sorts of

circles around it and I had some inkling

that he might have been fleeing trouble

back east I never pressed the matter I

had a lot of gratitude to him for taking

me along sharing his food in his bed

with me

and rescuing me as I saw it from a life

of grief and Missouri dirt it became

apparent as we traveled the blessings

were not entirely one-sided it turned

out I was far more suited to the

hardships of the trail than him and far

more skilled at keeping the wagon moving

than he was I nursed him through a fever

as we crossed through Colorado and more

than once I even punished to avoid an

attack by natives securing the Wagoner

small ravine until the war party had

passed by all told I feel I more than

earned my bacon I still remember the

first time Benjamin's sauce skulls near

our campsite those travelers before us

who had not fared as well as we had poor

man almost fainted and I could not help

but reflect that were it not for me he

would likely have joined those poor

departed souls I decided not to share

that particular reflection we reached

the Laramie River and forged John in

October it was a squalid little fur

trading post in Wyoming with thick

wooden walls that were solid enough to

keep out any war minded natives and

there were all the signs that a great

many people had recently passed through

the place the manager an officious man

who introduced himself as Bruce told us

that we had missed the chance to safely

cross the Rockies that the passes would

be snowed up within the month he said we

could winter a for John if we had the

food and money for it or we could turn

round and leave from his tone of voice

it sounded like he had not much care for

which of the options we chose we were of

course devastated and spent several days

discussing our options and tried to make

a decision as to the wisest course of

action though he knew that for every

hour we spent in such conference our

choices became fewer and the

consequences sharper it was at that

point we were approached by a man who

introduced himself as Eustace wick he

was a short squat figure broad of

shoulder and with the rough dark skin of

one who has spent most of his life under

the Suns on forgiving glare

his long shaggy beard was shot through

with gray but his eyes sparkled with a

cunning and intelligence I would not

have expected to see from such an

unkempt face he also possessed one other

attribute which surprised me though in

hindsight it takes on a somewhat

sinister light he had in his mouth a

full and healthy set of teeth

now mr. Eustace wick inquired as to our

purpose in Fort John and speaking far

more candidly than I was truly

comfortable with Benjamin explained to

him our journey and our dilemma but the

mention of the words Willamette Valley

the short man's eyes lit up and a smile

practically split his face into four he

was so he said the best guide since

Sacagawea and could get us through the

Rockies long before the snows hit with

any force for a price when he said this

he smiled and all the square and shining

teeth in his mouth seemed to catch the

light I was hesitant as I'd met plenty

of hucksters and bandits who were keen

to pass themselves off as guides and as

Benjamin haggled the price my misgivings

grew for useless wick seemed off a

little in the way of resistance and we

secured his services for only twenty

dollars plenty of money to be sure but

for the services he was offering and the

dangers involved it was practically

nothing unfortunately for all my

consternation it soon became clear that

Benjamin had made up his mind to hire

the man to be fair to him we did not

have the resources to winter and for

John were we to try and make our way

back there was every possibility the

weather would still turn deadly on us we

were caught between the devil and the

sea and Benjamin had determined that

guided by Eustace wick we were going to

try and swim the poor fool had no idea

the devil was the one leading us into

the water nobody tried to stop us

leaving though it was clear from the

looks upon them they believed us to be

dead already my own hopes for a Swiss

gas hire but the little man who now rode

with the scaffold and joked as we

traveled keeping Benjamin in higher

spirits than I had seen him in months

this began to fade as the cold air began

to hit us and the paths through the

Rockies became steeper and narrower the

journey was hard but we pushed on for

almost a week

Eustace wick seemed to be as good as his

word keeping us on those trails that the

wagon could use without too much danger

the cold robbed us of sleep though

and after those first days the once

beautiful vistas and rolling peaks of

the mountains seemed to become jagged

and vile ribs jutting from the carcass

of the world and picked clean by

vultures benjamin became quiet

I became sullen Eustace wick became more

aggravatingly jovial than before by the

time the first snowflakes began to fall

he was practically hooting with joy my

suspicions about his motives had begun

to freeze into an icicle within my chest

hard and focused when we woke up one

morning a week and a half into the

journey to find one of our wagons wheels

smashed and destroyed beyond repair

I could not find it in myself to be

surprised the snow was falling thickly

by this point we had already used all

our replacement wheels over the many

months of the journey we were trapped

there and would surely die it was then

that Eustace wick appeared standing on a

nearby Rock that same big grin on his

face he told us that there looked to be

a snowstorm coming but he had found a

nearby cave where we could wait it out

he didn't even pretend dismay of the

state of the wagon Benjamin and I

followed him and sure enough there in

the side of the mountain was a shallow

but well hidden cave it's hard to say at

exactly what point I realized

specifically that Eustace wick was

planning to eat us it may have been that

he made no mention of retrieving any

food from the wagon when he led us to

his den it could have been the piles of

firewood already neatly stacked up

against the far wall cut into logs it

might just have been the way he looked

at Benjamin with his square white teeth

bared an unearthly smile but somewhere

between the wagon and the cave I became

convinced that our so-called guide but

lured us up here with no intention short

of killing us and eating our flesh I had

no time to communicate this thought to

my husband however who still seemed

woefully oblivious of the situation and

once we were inside the small cave there

was no privacy in which to discuss it so

I just had to sit there watching used to

Swit building a fire as Benjamin tried

to suppress his shivers and make

conversation with the man who he still

did not realize

had turned from our guide into our

captor I simply watched and waited as

the storm began to descend outside and

the warmth of the fire was quickly

overcome by the icy chill of the wind

night began to fall the fire was the

only light casting along dancing shadows

upon the walls behind us I could feel

hunger gnawing at me and was sure that I

was not the only one but I had a strange

thought that the bearded man

squatting the other side of the flames

was waiting for someone to mention it so

I refused to do so my husband of course

had no such reservations and began to be

moan our forgetfulness at leaving what

little food we still had in the wagon of

this used a Swick's smile if it went

even possible got wider and he said that

we had all the food we needed he stared

into the fire and began to mutter

something it sounded like a prayer I

think he was in his own demented way

saying grace I remember the words

exactly he locked eyes with Benjamin and

said come

be my guess Anna left thy gifts to me be

blessed as he said this as silence fell

across the cave the wind died and the

shadows on the wall stopped moving as

though they were watching the scene in a

rapt attention

Eustace wick withdrew a long sharp knife

and stalked over to Benjamin who made no

move to defend himself his eyes were

wide staring at the mad cannibal

approaching him with a look of both fear

and abjure the whole scene was so

utterly unreal that it took me almost a

full second to remember and draw my gun

all through this journey I had kept my

father's camp locked pistol hidden

tucked inside my crenel in Benjamin knew

about it of course but it obviously

never mentioned it to Eustace had I had

a possibility of reloading it I might

have drawn it earlier but with only a

single shot and I have barely passable

shooter I knew that I needed to be sure

of my moment as it turned out I left it

too late for even as I placed the barrel

to the temple of the foul murderer and

pulled the trigger he drew the blade

across my husband's throat there was a

terrific bang a splash of brain and a

spray of blood the two men fell dead

upon the floor and I found myself alone

in the Silence of the icy night I'm sure

I need not tell you the tears that I

shed that night tears the what I see

even before they touched the ground I

wept for my beautiful stupid Benjamin

and I wept for my own life now most

certainly lost at the cold and snow and

to hunger he was as this last thought

passed unbidden through my mind that I

heard it very faint

calling softly the sound of Benjamin's

voice I called over to him for a second

overjoyed that he might be alive but as

soon as I touched his ice cold skin

already beginning to turn blue I knew

that it could not be so despite this his

head began to turn towards me and his

frozen eyes opened his lips parted above

the gaping red slash across his throat

and he spoke

eat me he said I left back shaking my

head praying the Lord to rid me of these

terrible visions but his voice came

again clearer and louder this time

begging me attend to eat him he told me

how good he would taste better than any

salted pork I could cook him over the

fire he said and the cold would keep him

fresh for as long as I needed I yelled

at him screamed at him to be quiet for

whatever devil had taken up inside to go

back to hell but it made no difference

still he pleaded to be eaten it has been

five days now and Benjamin still

entreats me he taunts and curses me by

turns calls me a coward who would rather

die than be part of something greater

than myself the entrance to the cave has

all but blocked with snow and even if I

were to dig my way out there is nowhere

for me to go I don't even know where

whatever's left of the wagon would be I

think I might try though now I have

finished this account of the events that

led up to my fate I hope whoever finds

this does not judge us too harshly we

were simply seeking a better life I

leave this here in the oil skins of

Eustace wick in the hopes it may be

protected from the depredations of

winter as for myself I will try to dig

my way out and get as far as I can I

will not survive but I hope the Lord

understands it is not suicide it is

simply that I can no longer stand to be

trapped here where the corpse of my

husband

begs me to make it to meet statement

ends certainly a grotesque tale but I

don't have access to the sort of

information required to verify any of

the details provided by the unnamed mrs.

Carlisle there is no record of any

Eustace wick that I could find there is

a Benjamin Carlyle mentioned in in 1838

census of Burke County North Carolina

but that's about it

the prayer apparently spoken by mr. wick

is a perversion of the old Lutheran

grace come Lord Jesus be our guest and

let thy gifts to us be blessed

there was a noted Lutheran preacher by

the name of Horatio wick that is

mentioned briefly in several histories

of Massachusetts as rather violently

falling out with his colleagues in the

church

the sacrament of the Eucharist 

but he apparently drowned in 1832 

what interests me most is how this unsigned letter, if it is to be believed, made its way from an icebound cave in Wyoming or Idaho all the way to the personal collection of Jonah Magnus 

__??__

the preceding conversation was overheard on the 19th of November, 2016. it reaffirms my current worries about Tim, though does go some way to reassure me that Martin is unlikely to be the culprit, especially following our earlier conversation. 

I need to be more careful.
