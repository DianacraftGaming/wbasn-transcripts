statement of Elias Bouchard regarding

the dreams of Jonathan Sims head

archivist of the Magnus Institute

currently unresponsive details pulled

directly from subject statement begins

the archivist does not know where he is

and in many ways that is correct for to

say that he was anywhere would be an

error

he has no conception of his body lying

on that gray hospital bed perplexing the

doctors heart unbeaten lungs unmoving

but mind and nerves alive and firing

wildly everything but brain-dead but he

is where he exists so often when his

eyes are closed he wanders the dreams he

was given a cold and well cleaned room

sterile metal tables that overflow with

a gentle trickle of blood the hearts

that beat upon them spasm and spurt

without any sort of rhythm and were they

to stand still for but a moment it might

become clear just how wrong they are in

their construction there are no strange

figures standing over those tables no

mockeries of earnest learning but in the

center stands a weeping bearded man in a

lab coat in his thin vinyl gloved hands

he holds an apple that he dearly wishes

otherwise

the doctor cannot bring himself to look

at the tables so instead looks to the

archivist whose eye watches him and

cannot close he tries to scream to curse

at the archivist pleading to him for

peace for rest

the archivist watches as the blood

creeps along the tiled floor and pools

of the doctors feet desperate he tries

to throw the Apple and his observer but

it is too late the doctor has forgotten

how the elbows work and wrenches it to

the side with a sickening crack he tries

again to scream but he hasn't got the

throat right and the wheezing half

choked gurgle that escapes woodster pity

in the archivist if he had not heard it

so many times before the archivist waits

expecting to awaken but there is nowhere

for him to awaken to no Avenue of escape

from these dreams he turns to see the

familiar screen the familiar woman

beneath it she looks up at him with an

expression of recognition and we read

read she types and types and types her

fingers a blur flying across the

keyboard and yet never fast enough to

outrun the relentless words that flow

like dark water across the screen the

stretches off into the sky it hurts she

is shaking her head defiant in her

well-worn terror and tries with every

corner of her will to force back the

rolling tide of words it hurts her

fingers are still her hands raised to

her mind trying to think trying to

comprehend it hurts

she turns to stare at the archivist

there is hatred in her eyes and blame an

aching certainty that she is here

because of him he has brought her here

he watches as she slowly brings the

keyboard up to her lips fighting against

it every moment she bites down shards of

plastic cutting her fingers as the words

scroll unfettered across the screen for

miles and miles and miles and she is

gone the archivist wanders he is

searching though for what he does not

know he passes those places he can no

longer watch the silent wards of peeling

skin the empty warehouse of thick

darkness and frightened children the

rusted train car that smells of eager

infectious hate all through it the

shadow is above him the shape that gazes

down upon him bloodshot and unblinking

the rain is still there though it is

empty the long and desolate road slick

with the downpour a police cars lights

flashing over the unmoving fan the doors

are open and the too familiar statue

stand either side of the well-worn

wooden box he looks around his eyes

scanning this forever road and the

clouds of iron gray looking for her but

she is not there the archivist expects

he hopes to find the violence in her

looking back at him

hungry for pursuit and murder

but the emptiness of the place is

complete the only sounds the gentle

singing of the box and the pounding

bitter rain he knows the writing on the

coffin has changed though does still

carve deep into the splintered wood I am

for you he knows it is not addressed to

him but he reaches down and pulls the

chains off all the same it opens and he

walks slowly down the steps into the

earth but even as it closes above him

the great shadow still sees him there is

nowhere in this universe that it would

not blot out of the sky the rough hewn

tunnels go down down beyond anything but

sodden earth and despair until the

archivist arrives at the tunnels here he

sees the Train twisted and pressed in on

all sides nothing but shrieking metal

and cracked glass he climbs inside and

takes his seat mouth tasting of mud and

soil his eyes moving through the dust

and grit unblinking the passenger is

there though she is as always stationary

dry dirt trickles between her teeth as

she smiles mirthlessly seeing the

archivist has returned she is relaxed

suspended from a dozen broken handrails

and shattered jagged seats they cut her

flesh but she does not bleed there is no

pain in her eyes there is nothing except

the certainty of her fate

the Train begins to move the wheel

screaming with the awful weight of it

every part buckling and pressing in

but the archivist is not afraid his only

fear is that even here at the center of

the world barreling towards a flightless

infinite tomb still he will be watched

still he will watch the expression on

the passengers face does not change even

as the contorting metal crushes her

skull like an egg as she vanishes from

view he catches a glimpse of an advert

above his seat dig there is a door in

front of him a yellow door he knows the

dream it used to lead to he knows it

well but that's not where it leads

anymore he does not know what is behind

it anymore and he is deathly afraid of

finding out the archivist turns away

behind him are the ants they move like a

terrible rolling wave along the

hard-packed ground and he can see every

twitching antenna every clenching

mandible somewhere underneath that

twitching burrowing mass is the

exterminator he is screaming the

archivist knows he is screaming can see

him screaming although the sound is lost

under the noise of those hundred million

ants that crawl and scurry over

everything for a second a hand breaches

the shifting mound desperately stretched

towards the archivist in supplication

pleading for help

the archivist watches as it disappears

painfully back into that sea of

scrabbling life then all at once the

ants are gone fled in a moment away from

the still shuddering form of the

exterminator

and a familiar terror finally pushes his

way into the archivists heart before him

Rises an incinerator door the glowing

light of the flames curling around the

cracks with a wailing shriek the door

opens and the burning silhouette that

stands within is ingrained upon the

archivists racing mind they smoke and

sizzle but still the worms crawl through

her charred and pockmarked flesh her now

singed red dress shifting with the

movement beneath it the exterminator

looks to her then to the archivist and

it is not certain which he fears more

the archivist for his part is hopelessly

willing the dream to stop but as she

takes one scorch step after another it

is clear that he has no power to make it

when faced with her

he even longs for the terrible dream of

the melted woman who would see

everything desolated without rhyme or

reason

but she was beyond his reach the moment

she knew he was there so the archivist

can only stand and stare as the hive

goes about its infested long dead work

the dark building is newer but he knows

it well knows the two lost souls who

creep through it with an alert hunger on

their faces he recognizes that look from

the other hunter whose dreams he is

watched for so long they stalk the

darkness itself and hope to catch and

kill it before it can do the same to

them they see him watching but they

cannot catch his scent

at last he is in the moonlit graveyard

the oldest of the dreams it is peaceful

cool and damp as the rolling boggy

fields stretch out in all directions he

hears her calling pathetically from the

bottom of the graves but by now he knows

there is nothing he can do but stare she

begs to be released to dream of this

place no more but there is nothing he

can do so he watches her trying in his

single-minded focus to ignore the

attention of that impossible thing that

covers the sky and fixes its gaze on him

with such force it would choke him were

he breathing

another dissection room another figure

standing in its centre but this one is

calm

she simply looks at him sadly a pity in

her face that burns him worse than any

flame more than anything the archivist

wants to look away to turn his eye from

her gentle sadness from the

disappointment in what she sees in him

but he cannot so he watches her until

she simply fades away and at last the

archivist looks up at last he looks into

the eye that sees all and knows all and

clutches at the secret terrors of your

heart the ceaseless watcher of all that

is and all that was the voracious

infinite hunger the tears at his soul

invoking him to discover to observe to

experience all and everything and

forever it stares into him and it stares

out of him and he is falling into the

devouring eternity of its pupil he wants

to cry out in horror but he cannot

he is hole

and still he does not wake wondering his

slim collection of gifted nightmares

passing the cray and lifeless remains of

severed dreams he can no longer watch he

waits but not for long before they all

begin again you're doing well John I

only hope you can continue your growth

without my guidance come in hello

inspector Martin I'm sorry to hear about

him don't and Daisy I suppose don't you

dare

I suppose it's some consolation basura

made it out and John more or less is

this him yes right Elias Bouchard you're

under arrest on what crime take your

pick

never had a tape recording of a murder

before something of a novelty and that's

not the half of it plenty of stuff in

those files could easily get you a nasty

end if you weren't careful no Melanie

I'd have thought she would have wanted

to gloat no you didn't tell her worried

she might create too much of a scene I

understand I just hope she doesn't hold

it against you that's that's not don't

worry Mr Blackwood we will take it from

here I'm sure you will however before we

proceed I have a flash drive in my shirt

pocket please ensure it gets the chief

inspector Henderson it contains various

information I think she and the

Metropolitan Police would be keen not to

have released to the public yes I was

briefed that would probably be the case

can't let you go though not with all the

evidence kindly provided by your

colleagues I quite understand I would

just hate for my case to be too

truncated not my place to say mr.

Bouchard I'm just here to get you behind

bars you and the chief can discuss the

rest it's better than you deserve

perhaps so but I'm glad you were

sensible about it I

concerned you might have bought into

Melanie's fixation gave you to us all

but wrapped up in a bow I must admit I'm

impressed Martin I knew you were all

planning something of course but I

didn't believe you specifically would

have the capacity for boldness that you

displayed it took me quite by surprise

he didn't just see it in me honestly I

didn't look for all my power I will

admit I am not immune to making the

occasional lazy assumption I presumed

that I knew you thoroughly but by the

time you demonstrated otherwise well

there was simply too much to keep

watching over only have two eyes after

all right are you all done now I believe

so I think we should be fine provided

you make sure the data reaches the chief

inspector I'm sure she'll be happy to

pick you out a cell personally so long

as it isn't the morgue I'm sure I'll be

perfectly comfortable just be careful

with him all right he can see things put

thoughts and stuff into your head like I

said I've been briefed and the situation

is being monitored quite unnecessary I

assure you just please be careful he's

really dangerous by all means mr.

Bouchard why don't you have a look in my

head and see exactly what will happen to

you when you mess with me there will be

no need for that inspector I'm sure

we'll get along famously good

best of luck Martin let the others know

I shall be thinking off them come on now

are those really necessary not really no

I see let's go goodbye Martin be seeing

you

must be a relief honestly I thought

they'd be more of a scene but he always

surprises me what what are you doing

here mr. Lucas please call me Peter no

no I think I'm okay as you like look

don't let Elias get to you you did very

well

really I honestly think you managed to

surprise him even if you sooner die than

admit it I'm sorry I'm I'm still not

sure exactly what this is oh right of

course

well you've successfully managed to

remove Elias as the head of the Magnus

Institute so oh oh god what does that do

oh no no no no no not in any

metaphysical sense no he's still very

much the how did he insist on phrasing

it yes the beating heart of the

Institute but practically speaking he

can hardly fulfill his more mundane

managerial duties from a jail cell so he

knew this was going to happen

not exactly he anticipated that you

would likely find some way to remove him

so he made alternative arrangements

which would be you exactly to be honest

with you Martin

I didn't expect to be taking over the

place so soon or in quite such a state

of disarray but I'll do my best to keep

the place afloat all right oh what's

that look for you one I am sorry if it

doesn't look quite like you hoped but

here we are I suppose so

so what now well if you could send

Melanie and Becerra up to see me I'd

like to introduce myself

after that I'll put through a couple of

weeks of paid leave for you all I think

giving everyone some space to try and

deal with the loss of Damon Daisy might

do everyone some good oh and if you want

to talk to a counselor the Institute

will of course cover any

cost and thanks don't mention it I know

how it can be with a new boss I'd like

to help you ease into it is that can I

go of course

oh and Elias said you'd probably be

keeping a close eye on the archivists

condition so I'd be keen to hear any

developments

sure marvellous and don't look so down I

know change can be scary but eventually

it happens just the same I think we're

going to great things Martin great

things
