#### ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

how much do you know about the Prison Service 

not much HUD bet 

maybe you've seen a few prison movies 

think you know a bit about how it is in there 

you've got to keep face and watch your back

right 

after all you never know who's got a ship with your name on it 

well for a start you're probably thinking of American movies about American prisons and I can't speak to that 

maybe it is non-stop gang warfare over there 

but in my experience the biggest danger and a prison is and always will be boredom 

I say that like it's some glib observation but we work hard to keep it as boring as possible 

the first hint of violence among the inmates gets smacked down 

I worked as a prison officer in Her Majesty's Prison Wakefield or the monster mansion as the press insists on calling it

it houses the real scum of this country

class-a dangers the lot of them and it was always a point of pride to me that we kept that place quiet 

I mean I say it like I had any real power but I was just a grunt keeping an eye on a cage full of wild animals 

I won't even pretend I was proportional in my use of force

I mean prison inspector would have been over there with me already 

but the sort of things you have to have done to end up in Wakefield well 

let's just say the suicide attempts far outnumbered the murder attempts 

and I never lost any sleep over that fact 

not at any of the inmates I made sure of that

after lockup at 7:00 p.m. sharp I made a point of keeping my wing dark and quiet

it helped that they were single cells of course 

no worries about conversational violence between cellmates 

but even then I was careful to make it very clear that drawing my attention after lights-out was something they would regret

I'll admit I was a real bastard when I worked fair 

sometimes you need a bastard to keep an eye on the monsters

and back then I really thought that the murderous filth we were looking after were the closest thing this world had to real monsters 

I was wrong of course 

I've been working there for almost five years when Robert Montauk came to us 

now don't get me wrong we've had plenty of celebrity criminals passed through Wakefield over the years 

but I can't say it didn't give me a slight chill to know that we were going to be keeping watch over the most prolific British serial killer of all time 

I mean he killed 40 people that's a ridiculous number

I mean maybe an America where you have so many places to hide 

but his nearest competition in this country barely reached half that and he used to be a policeman 

all told you have the ingredients for a cocktail of posturing unrest and violence among certain quarters of the inmates 

he wouldn't normally have gone to Wakefield as his crimes had no sexual element to them 

but we were the only ones that had space for a prison 

and eating that level of security and scrutiny 

he was a big guy 

I wasn't expecting that to be honest

usually with that kind of prisoner they've got her you'd never know to look at them sort of feeling 

but montauk looked like a killer 

he must have been almost six foot six and built like a barge 

his dark hair was cropped close to his scalp showing off a flat angular face 

not to put too fine a point on it but the man was terrifying

when he entered the rec room for the first time I could almost hear the deflating egos as a dozen would-be hoodlums thought better of trying to make a reputation by standing up to Robert Montauk 

of course there's always one and in this case it was a van Ilic 

an aspiring Serbian gangster who decided to go after him 

jumping him from the side 

me and the other waters had been waiting for something like this but we were too slow to get there in time 

well maybe we could have gone faster but 40 murders 

sometimes you want to look at what you're up against

illa to smile an and nearly matched Montauk in height if not in weight 

but there was an energy to Montauk 

a tightness like a rubber band about to snap 

Ilic left forward with a shout and delivered a solid punch right into the other man's kidneys 

but it was as though he'd hit the pressure pad on a bear trap

with terrifying speed the hands snapped round gripping the serbians right arm

there was a half moment of complete silence as everyone seemed to be holding their breath to see what Robert Montauk did next

he brought his hands around with a violent twist cleanly dislocating his assailants arm with a nasty pop

replacing the silence with a scream and a string of Slavic curse words 

at this point me and the other screws broke it up

I got the unenviable task of taking the still cursing of an alleged own to get his arm treated 

I didn't see Montauk again for some time 

after that little incident he was immediately transferred over to F block where he wasn't going to be a danger to anyone but himself 

I'd occasionally hear rumors about him filtering through the other inmates 

and there wasn't a spooky story in a Wakefield that didn't have him at the center of it 

barely a week went by without some loudmouth nobody spreading word that he'd killed the guard or escaped or being found dead in his cell with his heart ripped out 

he was never true of course 

not at that point 

I think most of it came from Dave Harrington on F wing 

he always loved to drop the fake gossip on new inmates 

and the old hands

and you not to trust a word he said 

it was 1998 

wet 

------

hello 

sorry can't be too careful 

accidentally mentioned you won one of my earlier official recordings

and had to go back over it 

oh sure 

#### BASIRA

I've got another tape for you 

fantastic

here's the other one was there anything on it 

oh very much so a Russian circus

then oh 

but nothing relevant to Gertrude's murder 

look that's what you mean

it is why 

I mean right sorry 

have you had a chance to listen to any of them yourself

well the precincts has exactly one tape player and exploded when I tried to put batteries in it 

put in a requisition for a new one

but that's lost summer in the mat 

and I haven't had a chance to chase it up 

no well if you keep bringing them to me it's better than nothing 

yeah anyway I thought you could try this one next

Alexandria 

hey at least this one actually has a label 

I figured you're probably into old libraries and stuff 

no you're right

Thank You Basira 

honestly 

yeah oh

what's the name of that helper of yours

Martin 

no no the hot one he has scars like you but kind of manages to pull them all so 

Tim 

yeah what's his deal 

he gave me the weirdest grin when I came in just now and like the thumbs up 

I I wouldn't worry about it 

no 

he thinks we're sort of together 

oh oh oh no 

you know I'm no 

I know I mean either I just

got it in his head 

I mean you're nice and all 

yes yes no I feel the same way

right I mean I suppose it's better he think that

I won't tell if you want

right I'm gonna go then 

yes yes right

statement resumes 

it was in 1998 that I next came into regular contact with Robert Montauk 

the government had commissioned the construction of close supervision centers in prisons all over the country 

and Wakefield was one of the flagship initiatives 

a good portion of F wing was given over to our own CSC soon

to be known as the exceptional risk unit

it could only hold eight prisoners but they were to be the worst of the worst

kept under constant scrutiny and given no chance to harm anyone 

I was picked to be one of the officers transferred into the new unit 

I don't know if it was specifically because I had more inmate altercations on my record than any other prison officer at Wakefield 

but given the intensity of the set up I'm sure it didn't hurt my application

Robert Montag was an obvious choice for the exceptional risk unit 

during his time in Wake free he had been involved in several further violent incidents 

and though he hadn't yet killed anyone inside the prison the higher-ups reckoned it was only a matter of time

so in he went 

the CSC was not a nice place 

Wakefield had had the budget to make it secure but not to make it anything less than starkly utilitarian

the individual cells were cramped and claustrophobic with almost no natural light filtering in from the outside well

they still got their exercise but it was in bare metal cages 

we kept them separated from each other almost as much as we kept them from the rest of the prison 

you must never underestimate how violent and desperate a trapped animal can become 

we were cruel to them 

I'm not ashamed of that 

if I were to tell you all the crimes of those monsters we kept in the ER you you probably lose your lunch before I was halfway through  the list 

keeping them beat down was the only way to make sure they behaved 

and besides atonement is important

I'll admit though I always had a soft spot for Robert Montauk 

he never gave us any trouble away from the other prisoners 

he seemed too docile 

almost eerily so sometimes 

also and it's a small thing but he never denied his crimes 

Wakefield is one of those prisons where everyone is innocent 

and it gets so dull to hear their whining protestations a day after day

anyone who fully owned their crimes always went up in my estimation 

I mean we still beat him down on occasion but not as bad as the others 

after a year or two I kind of started to forget who he was 

you know the mystique of being Britain's most successful serial killer just didn't hold up when you have someone in your power like that 

you forget any respect you might have had for them 

and he never gave us any trouble

in 2001 he started to get visitors 

his daughter mostly 

given that she hadn't visited before I'd guess you just turned 18 

you get that a lot

unaccompanied visits aren't allowed under that age 

and plenty of inmates have kids living with overprotective Guardians who refused to take them 

so I assumed she was similar 

the visitor rooms in the main prison are quite nice

not so much in the exceptional risk unit

the dark bear room like all of them cut down the middle with a reinforced window

there were plenty of lights in there but somehow it always seemed gloomy 

I was on observation for a few of their father-daughter visits 

she would talk about her life like her dad wasn't a murderer 

he would lie about how it wasn't too bad in the prison 

it was all very touching I'm sure 

aside from his daughter there was only one other time that he had a visitor 

it was six months before he died 

late March 2002 

he was an older guy I'd guess late 50s wearing a well-tailored black suit and an expression of disgust 

when I brought Montauk in his face fell 

he went very pale

I'd help folks beat Robert Montauk a dozen times or more but I had never seen him look scared 

he sat down opposite the old man and they looked each other in the eye through the thick glass

I think the visitor might have been blind 

his eyes were cloudy but he had no cane or dog 

and it didn't seem to affect how he looked at Montauk 

neither of them spoke 

the seconds turned into minutes and still they didn't say a word 

they just sat there staring 

given where I work it's really something to be able to say that I've never seen two people who hated each other as much as Robert Montauk and that old man 

after a few minutes I was all but ready to drag him out but as I stepped forward the lights blew 

all of them at once 

leaving us in the dark

I had Pete Gordo the water with me on visitor duty fumbling for the handle on the door to get helpful torches 

I was tense ready to fight off Montauk if he decided to make a move 

but instead a soft voice came from out of the darkness 

I didn't recognize it but I thought it sounded like it came from the old man

I don't think he was talking to me 

you didn't think you could kill it for long did you 

that's what I said

then Pete got the door open and a shaft of light poured in from the corridor 

I could once again see montauk and the old man sat there motionless

it didn't seem like they'd moved an inch

though as I went to take montauk back to his cell I noticed that he was crying 

I didn't mention it 

I'll be honest I was kind of freaked out by the whole thing

the next few months were quiet

Montauk seemed even more subdued than normal and often had to be goaded into exercising during his allotted time 

the only point where he seemed normal was when his daughter came for her visits

and maybe that was just because he was already so huse to lying to her 

that was the summer we had all the plumbing problems in the ER 

you and the water kept going foul so we were all kind of on edge 

but nothing really happened until it turned to autumn and November rolled around 

it was November the 1st 

I remember because the date was read out so many damn times at the assorted disciplinaries that followed 

the worst part of it is I wasn't even doing anything wrong that day 

I was working the late shift with Pete and we were having coffee in the break room 

at least I was having coffee

Pete was swearing at the taps because the plumbing problem we had all have been assured was fixed was back and worse than ever 

the taps were discouraging a jet of foul-smelling stagnant water 

I was laughing at him sipping my own perfectly adequate drink

when all the lights went off 

it was more widespread than last time though it seemed like the electricity had gone off altogether 

we stood there in the pitch-black waiting for the generator to kick in or for whatever power problem this was to be fixed 

but after a few minutes of silence and darkness it became clear that that wasn't happening anytime soon 

in the distance we could hear the prisoners of the exceptional risk unit start to shout and holler

their cells were locked of course there was nothing a power cut could do about that 

but it was still up to us to keep order until the lights came back

I had hoped that the other prison officers on shift would have come by to pick us up 

but they were clearly busy elsewhere 

I call that to Pete making sure he was still nearby as I fumbled in the locker for my torch 

I finally found it and turned it on the beam was so bright in the oppressive darkness that I had to blink away tears 

using the light from mine Pete found his own flashlight and together we headed out into the sea SC 

we checked each cell in turn lying to the prisoners inside about when the power would be back and sending them back to their beds with threats of violence 

I didn't see any of the other waters around and was starting to get really nervous 

when we had checked all the other cells we went towards Robert Montauk's 

the torch beams shot out in front of us but as they fell upon the door to his cell something was wrong 

I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at for a second 

and then I realised that his cell door was open 

but the torch light wasn't reaching the inside 

as it hit the threshold he just stopped 

a clear and distinct line of darkness beyond which nothing could be seen 

from inside there came the wet sound of tearing and a low moan of pain 

I wanted to run but instead I took a step forward

my torch died

Peet's went off as well and we just stood there terrified unable to see a thing 

the sounds were no longer coming from inside the cell 

and that didn't really as much as it might have 

about 15 feet behind me I heard peaked fumbling around calling out my name 

I was about to reply tell him to stay where he was when I heard something that Pros my blood 

Pete said there you are

he was not touching me 

almost immediately there was a growl from the darkness 

it was throaty in a roar but at the same time sounded almost musical 

he screamed 

I heard him fourth of the floor

it was at that moment that the lights came back on 

we were alone

I ran to do a quick circuit of the CSC that the other prison officers arrived

but there was no one else there

apparently there been some problems with the doors and they hadn't been able to get to the main eru cells 

Pete was stormed the ground when I returned though he seemed physically unharmed 

it was one of the other waters that found what was left of Robert - Montauk 

I took the fall for it 

they didn't try to make out like I had killed him 

just that it had happened on my watch and due to my negligence 

they'd been trying to push me out ever since the prison inspector had written the CSE up for excessive use of force the year before 

they really threw the book at me gross incompetence 

it's a bitter phrase to say out loud 

what was I supposed to tell them a monster made of darkness murdered him

Pete was no help he handed in his notice two hours after the lights came back on

I didn't even get a chance to speak to him asked what had happened he was just gone 

I don't really have anything more to say about it 

it was a clearly paranormal incident that led to the end of my career and it's not fair 

#### ARCHIVIST

statement ends 

prison records are very hard to acquire for the close supervision centers due to the small number of inmates held there 

most information could be considered identifying so the Prison Service tends to hide behind data protection laws when asked about them

beyond that many of the prison records from before the mid-2000s have still not been digitized make follow up on this hard 

Tim hit something of a dead end trying to look up Peter Gordo 

though Sascha did manage to track down the 2002 visitor logs for the whole of Wakefield prison 

it took some searching but I managed to find what I believe to be the entry for the visit from mr. Brown's mysterious old man 

the name given is Maxwell Rainer 

Martin hasn't had much luck tracking down mr. Brown himself 

according to Caroline Brodie his ex-wife she left him in 2004 after his dismissal from the Prison Service pushed him further into alcoholism and he became abusive 

she says she got a single letter from him in 2009 asking for reconciliation but she never replied 

Martin says the letter was postmarked from Waterford in Ireland but he's been unable to track mr. Brown any further 

so what is this thing 

if it seems to obstruct Robert Montag through so much of his life 

and what's its connection to Rayner

were they summoning it, containing it, worshipping it? 

whatever the case it seems as though Montauk and its anger 

I feel it might be worthwhile getting a few more torches for the archive

End recording.

Supplemental.

I confronted Sasha about the wax museum. It was just too strange to not mention. I tried to pass it off like I had spotted her accidentally while in the area for other reasons. I doubt she bought it, but she did at least give me an answer. She has a new boyfriend, or so she claims, who works there and she likes to get lunch with him. It is plausible, and at this stage I feel challenging her to produce said boyfriend would potentially damage what trust remains between us

No luck with any of my other leads yet, but at least I have another of Gertrude's tapes. It's always going to be a shot in the dark with them, but hopefully an informative one. 

I know the secret to her death is on one of them.

it must be honest 

I hope I don't have to hear it firsthand.

End supplement.
