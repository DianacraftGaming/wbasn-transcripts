well she said she could turn it on

didn't say anything about jogging look

we're on the same side if you're telling

the truth I mean I don't know what proof

I can give you oh well if you're right

about it it won't be long until Officer

muster man over here is able to talk

again that should be illuminating he's

almost got his lungs again if you can

call them lungs uh as long as they can

push air and it'll do and if you don't

like what he has to say then this cabin

is a long way away from anything that

can hear you and if I run I'm very much

hoping that you do I read your statement

you know you you don't kill people how

many monsters the line gets blurrier

every day what about you Julia following

in your dad's footsteps it's a legacy

I've learned to be proud of there are

people who'd sell us all out the things

you can't even imagine I'm happy doing

what it takes to stop that murder why

not everything dies you think if you

walk out of this cabin you just keep

going something gets you even if it's

just time mostly though life on this

planet ends violently it's the most

natural thing in the world and sometimes

it makes the world a better place and

when something comes for you then I die

that doesn't scare you every second

can we keep that somewhere else

I want it where I can see it and when

you're satisfied that I'm not trying to

harm you if you're right about that

ritual I guess you talked to Gerard

you said he was dead he is right so we

just wait that's the plan

perhaps if all we can do is listen to

this regrowing itself and mainly suggest

a way to pass the time

sure you want our story gave you folks

plenty already I mean yes but the

situation has changed quite a bit last I

heard you were dying of lung cancer I

was and now I'm not and that doesn't

strike you as odd not much I see these

days isn't odd some hour over not gonna

terminals up one bit if that worked out

well for me

I hunt monsters my lungs don't kill me

seems like a fair trade

no big job did it what about you Julia

okay

care to make a statement maybe about how

you met Trevor sure why not

thank you it's not like you or your tape

recorder get to leave here without us

statement of Julia Montauk regarding her

initial encounter with the hunter Trevor

Herbert when did this happen

about six years ago seven 2010 sure

summer 2010 statement taken direct from

subject June 29th 2017 statement begins

I tried to live a normal life I really

did

I took jobs working in the backroom of

offices where I wouldn't need to meet

anyone

hi boyfriends who promised they didn't

CAIR I burned through half a dozen

counselors none of it worked you see my

father's always remained one of the

darlings of the true crime community

articles documentaries grisly

retrospectives wherever ended up somehow

it would always warm its way into my

life one of my co-workers or new friends

would stumble across a profile of my

father and that would be that every time

I ended up in a relationship it was only

a matter of time before I caught them on

some true crime blog or spotted a

profile of my father in their search

history sometimes I tried to lie about

it

so there was no relation but the damage

was done they'd get distant throw me

nervous glances when they didn't think

I'd notice or worse they started to look

at me like I was some sort of prize some

small claim to fame the serial killers

daughter I suppose it could have changed

my name and something always stopped me

though it was the only connection I

still had to my dad

and even if it did keep ruining my life

I couldn't bring myself to lose it

the counselors and their therapists were

more understanding but even they

couldn't quite keep the eager quiver out

of their voice when I started talking

about the murders it felt like every

couple of years I was having to start my

life over from scratch what is it do you

think that makes people so obsessed with

horrific things happening to other

people even now after all I've done I

can't quite figure out what it is that

makes people treat actual atrocities

like cheap entertainment maybe we're all

just broken inside unable to really

grasp the difference between fictional

people and people would just don't know

they're all just abstract ideas we're

happy to have suffer for our enjoyment

or maybe the fact it really happened is

exactly the point

adding the awful spice of reality to

people's morbid fantasies when I think

of the lurid joy some people would feel

if I were caught the serial killers

daughter taking over the family business

it makes me sick but even back then with

my hands and blooded

that

active obsession with brutality chased

me throughout my life in the summer of

2010 I made another attempt to outrun my

father's legacy and moved up to

Manchester to take a new job it was

night shift work security and

maintenance for an old office building

occupied by a handful of failing

companies trying to save money on floor

space I liked it because I didn't really

have to talk to anyone I was on the desk

alone and generally anyone working there

late enough to cross paths with me

wasn't in a talking mood there was

another reason that I chose to work

nights if you read my statement then I'm

sure it will come as no surprise that

for most of my life I've had a pretty

significant fear of the dark

who still lie awake at night listening

straining my ears for the noise of

movement or that dreadful growl coming

out of the dark it was one of my better

counsellors that suggested I try working

nights as a way to address it and it

worked for the most part it made the

darkness mundane just another aspect of

my everyday life to be dealt with and

kept me within the comforting glow of

lamps and light bulbs basically all the

time it also let me sleep during the day

when the faintest hint of sunlight that

crept around the edges of my thick

bedroom curtains made me feel safe

enough to relax

it made dating even harder of course but

by that point I'd mostly given up trying

it wasn't a perfect solution by any

means but it helped to start with at

least I never really worried about

keeping track of the companies that kept

offices in my building it seemed like

that came and went pretty regularly

sometimes a start-up would make it big

but usually it was the inevitable

bankruptcy that moved them out all

except dkn systems I never really

figured out what it was they were meant

to be doing something full of

meaningless buzzwords like business

networks or media solutions thinking

about it it might actually have been

business media network solutions point

is they didn't seem to be anything

suspicious about them at least not at

first

I knew a bit more about them than the

other people renting space since they

seemed to do a lot of work after dark

and there are a handful of their staff I

knew on site I mean I assumed they also

did a lot of work in the daytime that I

just wasn't seeing so it didn't seem

particularly weird just another small

business burning the candle everywhere

they could to stay afloat but even if

the company itself didn't seem weird the

people who work for it really did I

remember there were four of them

normally around and at one point I

thought it must have been a family thing

because I got it in my head that they

were related I don't know why they

didn't even look that similar but there

was just something about their faces it

was the eyes I think it looked like they

all had irises so dark that they almost

seemed completely black and they dress

the same not like a uniform but they all

wore black trousers a dark blue shirt

and brown leather belt they also wore

soft soled black canvas shoes which were

almost completely silent when walking

down the carpeted halls of the building

it made them even more unsettling

quietly wandering the corridors never

quite looking where they were going I

their attention was focused on something

you just couldn't see there was only one

of them that ever spoke at least to me a

young guy called Vardhan Darvish he

seemed to be the manager at least as

much as there was any clear structure

and unlike his colleagues he seemed

happy almost eager to talk I asked him

about it once and he laughingly told me

that his co-workers didn't sign up for

the quality of conversation he'd chat

with me about my job and the latest

headline which he always had a strong

opinion about we never discussed any

details of his life though or his job he

generally came over to let me know about

a blown light bulb somewhere in the

building

and then stick around for a bit of

conversation how once jokingly suggested

he must be breaking the lights himself

or excused to talk to me and he laughed

but then got kind of quiet and didn't

stick around to talk at the time I

assumed my awkward flirting had made it

weird

but unfortunately not

walls were breaking because of what

we're doing around the offices

I've been tracking Darvish for a good

few weeks by then there been a couple of

homeless I knew gone missing around

Parsa ward where I'll keep him back then

no usually I wouldn't pay much mind was

the summer after all but there were a

couple of we is gone so I checked in

which shelters and a worker that dealt

with him but no one had the first clue

and you Maurice had at least a kid with

a woman down in Moss side so evil Ness

skipped town but she hadn't seen him

neither

our first thought were vampires as they

like to go after rough sleepers Bora

knew by then there were other Horus

kicking around not to mention your

mundane murderers didn't matter to me of

course not by then I had a hunt on and I

was going to see it through the world

long after I went down to see you Fork

so I was still convinced I were on the

way out and caution weren't something I

cared for don't recall exactly I would

Darvish go on my radar someone had seen

something that sent me somewhere that

led me to him I don't know pointees soon

as I saw him I knew he were there one

hour after their smell to him something

dark and sick rolling off him in waves

sure he didn't smell like a vampire book

he smelt like something that weren't

meant to be in this world so I reckoned

I best help him out of it took to

following him for a couple of days

didn't know exactly what he was or what

he wanted so weren't keen to charge

right in he seemed normal at first mind

happy enough in the Sun though he worked

night that's how I first saw him didn't

spot me but if he did he never paid me

no mind they never do

third night I spotted him at work taking

a delivery it were a big truck for some

company called outer Bay I tried to

follow them up since but didn't find

much and again maybe I didn't know what

I was looking for I mean to anyone else

the box that were on Lorden would have

looked like nothing much but if there's

one thing I know it's what a box looks

like when he's got someone inside

there's a certain shape it tends to be

and the for carrying it after take a

second to manage it shifting weight

might have looked like a big old flight

case but as soon as I saw it I was

certain there was somebody inside what I

didn't know was alive or dead looking

back I feel like an idiot I was watching

them unload that same case it was policy

to have whoever was working security

present for deliveries something about

insurance thinking about it

Ivan knows his trevor lurkin past the

fence though I didn't give much thought

to just another Tramp I had no idea what

they had in the box there they told me

it was new computer service and I didn't

have any reason not to believe them

they'd had plenty of similar deliveries

before Vardhan was there and we talked

for a while he wanted to discuss the

tennis I think but I've never really

followed sport he didn't seem suspicious

or weird and I had no reason to think

that this was anything other than a late

delivery of normal computer parts they

took the case up to their offices and I

returned to my desk with a fresh cup of

coffee and a plan to dig him for the

night with some episodes of an old radio

show Bo's working my way through the

plan went pretty smooth for an hour or

two with the exception of a couple of

dkn employee silently shuffling past at

unnerving moments when I happened to

glance up at one of the video feeds and

saw that the Tramp I saw earlier had

managed to sneak inside the building he

wanted hard at all that didn't even need

to break a window nothing just waited

until the last of the office where doors

were heading back inside they were slow

enough

pretty simple to tell them through

before the door swung shot once in I had

a lot for cameras because I knew there

were a security guard I'd seen her when

they were on Lord you know we're pretty

sure I could take her out if I needed to

in your dreams Elfman but I didn't want

it to come to that I tried to stay out

of sight but she must have spotted me

because soon enough I could hear her

coming my way I managed to duck into a

stairwell and head up towards a fourth

floor where the front of the building

said Daffy fishes company was I could

hear a behind me though so I ducked out

to floor early and nipped inside a

cleaning cover to wait her out I went

all the way to the fourth floor

not realizing that this get wasn't up

there the corridor light was out and I

made a note to replace it later as I

turned on my torch it was very quiet far

quieter than I would have expected for a

company installing new equipment I took

a moment to get my bearings and there

was no sound at all utter silence except

for the faintest drip drip drip coming

from somewhere up ahead I called out

first for the trespasser then for

Vardhan then for anybody who might be up

there but there was no answer my torch

beam fell on the door labeled dkn

systems it stood open and moving with no

light at all coming from inside as my

light crossed the doorframe I could see

the windows had been covered with thick

wooden boards and painted a dark matte

black in the corner of my mind I could

feel panic starting to claw its way up

as the darkness started to press in on

me I called out again but there was

still no reply

I wanted to turn around and run back to

the light but not enough not as much as

I wanted to overcome my fear I slowly

headed inside calling out every few

steps to make sure anyone who might be

in there knew I was with security inside

the rooms were bare completely empty

there was no sign they'd ever been used

to run a business and the only sign that

I wasn't the first person to set foot in

there was the complete absence of dust

or dirt I checked another room but it

was exactly the same the same with the

third I checked and the fourth then I

opened a normal-looking wooden door near

the back and I froze once again on the

threshold of something that didn't make

sense in front of me was what should

have been a normal meeting room but it

was far from that the floor was covered

in water pitch-black and utterly still I

knew in my mind it couldn't be more than

a few millimeters deep it didn't even

spread past the doorway when I opened it

but as my torch light reflected off the

surface it seemed to me like it was much

much deeper in the center of the room

was a plain wooden metal table with a

man lying on top of it I had never seen

him before he lay motionless and I could

make out a thin dark trickle of liquid

flowing from his mouth and eyes over his

face and dripping down the table legs

into the dark water three figures stood

around him the other workers from the

office each was stood on a small square

platform a few inches off the floor

facing directly towards the central

table arms outstretched and mouths wide

as though they were screaming they still

made absolutely no sound

I don't know how long I was frozen there

staring at the scene in front of me

nothing was right about what I was

seeing I started to scream at them

shouted to stop whatever they were doing

or I called the police they didn't see

me from remotely aware of me finally I

decided I was going to leave to make the

call

but not before I caught the man on the

table out of there he clearly needed

help and whatever these silent screamers

were doing to him wasn't helping I told

them I announced what I was about to do

but still got no response so I stepped

into the room and over to the table as

soon as my foot hit the water I felt

into it completely it was colder than

anything I had ever experienced and the

torch slipped from my hand as my vision

immediately went dark

I tried to orientate myself to find

which way was up and I saw a faint

pinprick of light as my torch sank away

from me down and down and down into the

icy black water I started to panic then

with the lightness deep pressing in on

me you get to take me away I was

absolutely sure that in a few moments

there would be no surface left just dark

still water forever luckily I'd been

watching a while I sort of go down

didn't have a clue what we're going on

still don't but I'm quick enough to get

there and reach me I'm into the water

before she were too far gone you were

bloody cold couldn't see anything

obviously I had my own lights but it

just bounced off the surface I could

feel the back of her jacket down there

though and I made a grab for it No

not as strong as I was maybe but I held

on and pulled want enough to get her out

something in there didn't want to let it

go but I got a high enough that her arm

broke the surface

she flailed a second well got hold of

the doorframe started to pull herself

out took her a while but she were almost

there when I heard something moving

behind us turned around to see Darvish

stood there and he did not happy however

is he holding the knife I could smell

him so thick it tasted like rancid

treacle and whatever he was shouting was

quiet and the blood in my ears it was

gonna be good I got him once across the

chest through his shirt but he were a

lot faster than I gave him credit for he

cracked me once hard across the face I

didn't go down but didn't get him with a

blade again before he slammed his elbow

to me got that time I did go down and

I've dropped to the floor you were on

top of me

hands around me throat and I thought

that was eat no waiting for the cancer

I'm not gonna lie I was scared I could

still feel that dark or just sticking to

me tugging at me pleading me to fall

back into it I pushed it from my mind

and I could just about make out the

homeless man that saved me he was

struggling with someone his torch fallen

to the ground next to an old pocketknife

I grabbed the light and pointed it at

them Vardhan was on top of him hands

around the old man's throat I saw those

eyes properly and for the first time I

realized that violins irises weren't

dark it was just that the pupils were so

wide that they swallowed them completely

the help wasn't what did it though

that wasn't what made me pick up the

struggling tramps pocket knife and

plunge it in again and again into

Vardhan Darvish his throat no what did

that was the tattoo huge and dark on the

chest beneath his rib shirt the closed

eyes sigil there was as familiar to me

as the nightmares of my mother

I have never felt rage like I did then

and I have never felt anything as

wonderful as the satisfaction of ending

his life

there was a shiver in the air is the

floor behind me Dryden in an instant and

the three silent scream has dropped down

dead well I suppose they might have just

been unconscious when they fell but they

were definitely dead by the time we left

the man on the table had never been

alive to begin with I just knew then I

never even had to explain anything to

her she just gave me back the knife and

we left together wasn't any question as

to a wall saw what I was doing we just

clicked hmm and we've been hunting

together going on seven years now she

ain't too bad at it you start to slow

down a bit though it's just the lack and

respect that gets me and he's going a

bit senile which is a shame

least I'm not so soft I need a

featherbed beds are a good thing old man

now keep telling you so a bath you see

what I gotta put up with mr. C yeah it

said what do you do for money

sorry I just I doubt roaming around

killing things pays all that well what

do you do to support yourself hard oh no

we find ways when you're out here the

odd bit of robbery or trespass doesn't

really faze you and why America

tella we're a wolf man all Davy's down

in Plymouth swore blind his brother had

seen one on the Pacific Crest

I told Trevor he was a liar but here we

are anyway have been for a couple of

years now

no wolf man sure but they've been plenty

out here that will needs killing

trim enough plus it's hard to leave

we're not exactly here legally and

trying to get a flight home would get us

noticed by authorities we'd rather avoid

keep telling that we could operable and

I tell him I'd rather stay hunting here

than trap myself on a boat for two weeks

so what have you

Shh whoa hey look who's talking you

could have at least chopped my ears oh

you people just won't shut up

how am I supposed to get the lungs lined

up right when I can't even come on some

trait I fit to chop them off again if

you need the practice I do oh yeah
