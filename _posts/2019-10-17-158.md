is everything alright Martin it's fine

don't particularly like it down here oh

yes of course hard to trust that door as

I imagine yeah well everyone else seems

to these days so but she's still the

same corridor as I suppose I'm sure what

was his name

Tim Tim really rather not talk about it

Peter very well this way but are you

sure about that Matt I'm pretty certain

the tunnels change oh don't worry about

that

inks practically still wet not to

mention if they do change well I happen

to have something that will change them

back that's a light nur it is and yeah

the blood on it that's one or two right

do you want to see how it works

no no I'd really rather you didn't no I

insist

watch

very impressive I'm reading shush dick

Peter Peter does it Peter I think

there's something in there mm-hmm

and stay quiet if I were you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Laughter]

that was Sam yes

planets it's going to make sure everyone

is too busy to follow us they'll be fine

probably you could still don't help them

if you insist

very good come on gone how just walked

out as far as we can tell a couple of

guards on duty vanished two vanished

how just left best we can tell he had

some doubt on them old friend at the

prison let us know what and no one

thought of that I thought could have

left at any time but he just sat there

laughing else no no this this can't be a

coincidence coincidence with what Martin

or someone left me a tape him and Peter

Lucas are looking for something down in

the tunnels do you know what no he

called it a device when I mean I don't I

mean now I guess they could it can't be

a coincidence that this is when Elijah

chooses to make a break for it you think

he's coming here you don't let's go I'll

get the key

what is this place

the panopticon of Milbank prison now

quite a smirk originally conceived it of

course

Jonah Magnus made certain adjustments

and it's been down here the whole time

why do you think this was chosen as the

Institute's location when the prison

closed it's a significant sight of power

for the beholder from the tower in the

center of this room you can see

everything but there's nothing in the

cells I don't mean the cells Martin I

mean everything come on mind your step

this comes from an era before safety

rails I don't a stand why are we here

it's quite simply I want to use the

powers of this place to learn about the

extinction what it's doing where it's

manifesting then we can stop it and you

need me for this correct without a

connection to the eye any attempt to use

it would likely end very messily indeed

but thankfully it just so happens that

you hold such a connection so that's it

post lonely and watching you must admit

you're the perfect candidate I suppose I

am there is of course just one other

complication first lonely and watching

you who is that

Jonah Magnus his body at least sitting

here watching binding it all together

growing ever holder if you want to take

his place well I'll need to kill him yes

don't worry though I brought a knife

where are his eyes exactly where they've

always been Martin watching over my

Institute and you're sure yes I'm sure

it wasn't here before

it's just that there's a lot of tapes

around and I don't keep any of them with

the key to the tunnels it's been left

for me and it says play me kind of

suspicious so Elias left it or Martin or

Peter or Annabelle fine whatever could

be a distraction only one way to find

out we don't have time for this we don't

know that we've no idea what sort of

time frame we're on I say play it thank

you did you really think I wouldn't

notice I'd rather hoped you'd still be

hampered with all the darks business

it's their grand eclipse at the moment

isn't it but I think we've both come to

the same conclusion about that that's

why you're here yes

shame really I used to be at a torture

building in half the time age catches us

all

well almost all of us Elias you were the

one so insistent on staying human and no

doubt that makes my death not less

complicated what exactly were you hoping

to achieve here why not come at me

directly instead of burning everything

first I was rather hoping the fire would

occupy you while I did just that I see

how long have you known about your body

why not come at me directly instead of

burning everything first I'd rather I

wasn't exactly a huge leap to the

panopticon after that the hard part was

figuring out how to actually reach it

took me the better part of a decade so

you burn the place down use it as cover

to reach my body and then we die

together

how poetic doesn't seem like your style

at all I wasn't actually planning on

dying and how exactly were you planning

on achieving that while you're still

bound to thee oh I see very clever

I thought Eric was the only one to

figure that little awesome knowledge has

a way of surviving you of all people

should know that quite it was a good

plan actually if you hadn't been so

complacent about me keeping an eye out

down here probably would have worked

Gertrude's grand retirement it still

might just needs a little spark and I

see so you're finally getting your hands

dirty I must really have caught you off

guard I suppose we both got a little

complacent fifty years is a long time

end of an era I'm not really in the mood

for nostalgia Elias you might have

noticed I'm rather busy so either shoot

me or

those tears

but it would hurt more

Beauty right so does that tell us

John John yes sorry right just uh the

panopticon it's the line of Milbank

prison based on an all-seeing Watchtower

I know I did the reading right you think

that's the device yes and I'd wager that

Isis body God join a Magnus right I'd

say so and he's been body hopping like

whatever was in Reina so is he going to

help Peter or stop him Lucas are

planning to take over the panopticon

can't imagine he wants that to happen

but alas put him in charge that doesn't

make any what Daisy are you stay here

both of you I'll check it out what are

you doing here why yes oh you needn't

worry two against one

I couldn't stop you if I wanted to I

just wanted to be here at the end can a

man at watch his own death what what how

are you even here wet don't let him

distract you Peter Elias both of you

just just shut up just give me a second

to think

of course you can take all the time in

the world come now Martin I would have

thought you'd jump at the chance to kill

me

that's not why wouldn't you help against

the extinction because I'm a busy man it

has never been my top priority I don't

believe you that really doesn't matter

I'm afraid it's the only answer you're

going to get by

if I do kill you will the other survival

Elias come now Peter it's a valid

question and you should have addressed

it yourself really the short answer is I

don't know that I guarantee it won't be

pleasant for them but I honestly don't

know if their ties to the Institute errs

quite as strong as I may have implied

you medleys should be insulated from the

fallout by or new Allegiance John might

be powerful about whether it

Melanie's whelped it so that just leaves

for Sarah and Daisy and the rest of the

Institute of course and you can't tell

me you care about them but of course I

do

do you though do you really care about

any of them or is that worrying just

simply no reflex goodness Peter has done

his work well hasn't he no the only

choice I think that matters is whether

you want to kill me oh I do I really

really do then do it Martin we're the

same you and I we don't need anyone else

watching from a distance that's always

who you've been have you enjoyed it

these last few months drifting through

the archives unseen uncharged you'll

like it in there I promise

yeah

yeah I think I would then do it

kill him and help me save the world

no well looks like two people an old guy

on a woman with a scar God now why now

it's probably not a coincidence from

what I saw they've been toying with the

rest the Institute but it won't be long

until they're all dead or escapes and

then they're coming here set up by the

door

try and take them when they break

through right do why do I get a gun

you're fired one you never told me you

never asked besides we've got problems

enough without hello oh go

[Applause]

what the hell is that thing you remember

what happened to Sasha that's the thing

that saw that it was trapped in the

tunnels it Martin something's happening

down there if you stand there with pizza

or Elias salmon we need to get down

there don't follow us

Jon go we'll keep them busy what no I

don't argue go fine just don't die go

that's my beer Sierra didn't think it

would end like this you know actually I

think I did

[Applause]

bashira promise me something

what no Daisy no basura this is over you

need to find me and kill me

promise me no no Daisy we'll figure

something out this last one say it was

always bottom time can't outrun it

forever

Daisy promise me I promise

Huck's no run Daisy

there you are Martin what are you doing

I'm saying no I refuse game over

Martin this is not the time for Petula's

there are bigger things at stake here no

I think that was actually the problem

you made the stakes too high all the

little details that didn't add up

it made the more obvious exaggerated the

extinction is come oh I'm sure it is but

that's not what this is about

is it this isn't about saving the world

it's all just some power play against

him I might not know exactly what's

going on but I don't think I want any

part of this however much I want to kill

him I'm out what you said honestly I

mostly just said what I thought you

wanted to hear I see this is your doing

is it hardly it's not him

not anybody it's just me always has been

when I first came to you I thought I had

lost everything John was dead my mother

was dead the job I had put everything

into her trapped me into spreading evil

and it really didn't care what happened

to me I told myself I was trying to

protect the others but honestly we

didn't even like each other

maybe I just thought joining up with you

would be a good way to get killed and

then John came back and suddenly I had a

reason I had to keep your attention on

me

make you feel in control so you didn't

take it out on him and if that meant

drifting further away so what I'd

already grieved for him and if it meant

now saving him it was worth it when you

started talking about the extinction

though you had me actually for a while

but then the Fen you tried to make me

the hero tried to sell me on the idea

that I was the only one who could stop

it

and that I've never sat right with me I

mean I mean look look at me exactly a a

chosen one but by then I was in too deep

so I played along waited to see what

your end game was and here we are funny

looks like I was right the first time

it's probably still a good way to get

killed

I warned you Peter but you do serve the

lonely oh I'm getting there but if this

is the final test or something the

battle the answers still no no no this

isn't fair do you have any idea what

you've done you knew he must realize

Jonah had nothing to do with it

no that's not you can't you've lost

Peter

admit it he played you like a like a

cheap whistle No

shut up Peter it's time

fine great now perhaps one of you then

can tell me what night it won't be that

bad

Peter you'll see now he'll be here soon

so you can leave oh oh no no I'm not

gonna make it easy on him

you haven't won yet your choice just

make sure to move the door ah Joe I was

almost worried you found your way all

right yes yes I did how it's a fighter

to say I called you what is this place

hmm a complicated question and time is

as the panopticon by you have grown yes

a masterpiece isn't it yeah

it is and that's you that your body not

anymore

but not me although if you harmed it it

wouldn't go well for me or any of your

friends for that matter maybe it's worth

it maybe and I'm sure in another

circumstance it would be more than

having to take your chances for a shot

of revenge but but for Martin time is

very much of the essence

where is he Peter Lucas has cast him

into the lonely and with every passing

moment he gets further away from you how

do I bring him back room out here

impossible you want me to follow him no

John you want you to follow him I simply

want you to know but if you do so you

are almost certainly not to coming back

to go into the lonely wittingly is as

good as death how do I do it

wasn't too long ago and I'm sure traces

of their passage still remain just open

your mind drink it all in know their

route and simply follow it

Berek are you scared

John yes
