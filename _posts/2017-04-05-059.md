statement of Ronald Sinclair regarding

his years spent in a teenage halfway

house on hilltop Road Oxford original

statement given November 29th 2005 audio

recording by jonathan sims head

archivist of the Magnus Institute London

statement begins I should have come in

to tell you people have had this before

really I heard about you interested you

back in the 80s and I thought should I

tell them but I didn't thought you'd be

all about old castles and ancient cans

not have any time for weird goings-on in

a suburban house in Oxford and your

academics as well so probably have more

rigorous standards than one crackpots

horror story still I saw last week that

they were planning to build on that land

again another house where the old

Fielding place used to be I don't know

it's not like you'd have any power to

stop the construction but I just I

needed to tell someone about it and you

were less likely to throw me out of my

air than the Planning Department of

Oxford City Council you see I lived with

Raymond fielding for almost three years

and believe me when I say that there is

nothing good that can come from

disturbing that dreadful place

I was a bad kid I've cleaned up my act

in the 40 odd years since but back then

I was a little thug wasn't entirely my

fault I came from a bad family my father

left before I was born and I'm not sure

how much you know about single

motherhood in the late 40s but it was

clearly hard enough that my mother ended

up with a serious alcohol problem I

won't go into the gory details of my

childhood but let's just say it's no

surprise I was out of school and in the

system before my 13th birthday

they tried a few places to set me

straight back then these sort of places

weren't quite as enlightened and the

only life lesson I learned were that Dan

was hard to take a beating finally when

I was 15 after the justice system was

finished with me for the third time I

was given the chance to reenter society

and offered a place at a halfway house

on hilltop Road

it's weird I've tried to get information

on it so many times in the year sense

but there's nothing there it's like it

never existed I mean this was a long way

pre-digital and files got lost plenty

but it still bothers me the most

traumatic thing that ever happened to me

and as far as any official record is

concerned I couldn't have even been

there

Raymond fielding was younger than I

expected every other place that people

in charge had been old leathery

moralists with skulls on their faces and

calluses on their knuckles a lot of

ex-military types who would lecture for

hours on how their wasted life had been

saved by the discipline of the army and

did their best to impose it on us Ray as

he insisted we call him was different he

couldn't have been much older than 30

and he let his brown hair grow long not

by today's standards I suppose but it

would have sent any of the crew-cut

authoritarians into a red-faced rage he

was friendly and approachable but didn't

seem like he was trying to be our friend

he was easygoing and smiled a lot but

there was something in his eyes that

made me wary of trying to take advantage

of him I didn't like him from the start

the other adults I'd met on my journey

through delinquency had been awful and

they'd run the spectrum from drippy

patronizing do-gooders to abusive thugs

but I'd always known I would know what

they were and where I stood with them

Ray was a mystery and that unsettled me

still he wasn't too strict with our

comings and goings and the other kids

staying there seemed all right

the one thing that surprised me was how

rare it was to see anyone come back most

other halfway houses I'd stayed in you

always had some of the older residents

those who had fallen into even worse

criminal company coming back

occasionally usually to sell drugs or do

some recruiting and feta means with a

thing back in the early 60s so I was

surprised when I moved into hilltop Road

and there wasn't a Purple Heart or a

black bomber to be found

it didn't seem like any alumni of Ray's

little family came back for a visit at

the time I just assumed it was a pretty

nice neighborhood so probably wasn't the

sort of place my kind as I thought of it

then made a habit of visiting I wasn't

wrong

the local residents hated us we never

really got into any proper trouble but

the sort of glares we got just for

smoking on the street made me want to

break a window sometimes I never did

though I'm not quite sure why I didn't

to be honest before I met ray I would

have there were plenty of broken windows

in my past there was something about

living there though that dulled the urge

my memories of a lot of my time there

are well not exactly foggy but feel

almost like I'm watching someone else's

memories I remember that it sometimes

felt like I do things without actually

deciding to do them like it was just

muscle memory moving me or a string

gently guiding me it was never bad or

dangerous stuff just things I wouldn't

normally have done by brushing my teeth

I'm glad for it now I've passed 60 and

teeth have stopped being something I

take for granted but at 15 the thought

never even crossed my mind when I lived

on hilltop Road I cleaned them every

night up and down and side to side

why are moving like I didn't even need

to think about it

the other kids living there were the

same at least I think they were I

remember them being kind of dull not

that they were boring exactly we'd spent

time together and smoke and play games

and the like but there was something

about them as though there were some

things that they said and did without

anything behind them occasionally

there'd be flashes of something by the

time me and dick Borrowdale snuck out

after dark and said mr. hainsley spins

on fire but mostly they were quiet

almost Placid I'm sure they'd have said

the same things about me and at the time

nothing seemed amiss I did what I did

because it was what I was supposed to do

they never struck me to question it I'm

not sure I really recognize who I became

while living at that house I did take up

reading though there was a shop down in

Kerry that kept a bucket of old pulp

magazines locked down to 6 pence because

they weren't the latest issue I used to

spend whatever money I had down there

and then I'd sit under the tree in the

back garden and read them cover to cover

over and over again they were daft

really but I loved them in the summer

with the leaves giving you just enough

shade to keep cool I'd say I was happier

than I'd ever been before then for the

most part Ray seemed content to stay out

of our hair and leave us to our own

devices he had his own study in the

basement where he spent almost all his

time and usually trusted one of us to go

to the grossest of food and sundries

aside from church which he made us

attend with him every Sunday he rarely

went out at all

occasionally one of the other residents

of the neighborhood would overcome their

distaste for us long enough to ask how

ray was keeping and whether he was well

I gradually got the sense that with the

exception of the teenagers staying at

his house Raymond Fielding was something

of a recluse a well liked recluse

certainly but to see him leave the house

on any day other than a Sunday was quite

a remarkable thing aside from church

there was one other regular activity

that he always insisted we take part in

we generally ate our meals in the dining

room which was a bit cramped

sometimes as when full there were eight

of us in the house aside from ray and

the table was barely big enough on

Sunday evenings however we'd all gather

for the evening meal and before we sat

down to eat he would remove the bright

white tablecloth that covered it and we

gather around the dark wood I remember

it was carved in all sorts of strange

swirling designs and patterns it felt

like if you picked a line any line you

could follow it through to the center to

some deep truth if only your eye could

keep track of the strands that had

caught it the center of the table looked

at first like it was simply part of the

wooden top but if you looked closely as

I did so often you could see an outline

marking the very middle as a small

square box carved with patterns just

like the ones that laced their way over

the rest of the table I don't remember

how long we sat around the table those

evenings nor do I have any memory of

what we might have eaten so I passed a

couple of years in relative peace I

actually studied stayed mostly out of

trouble and as my 18th birthday

approached it looked like

I might be able to find someone to teach

me a decent trade at that point I was

the oldest there by a few months the

others having left the house as they

each turned 18 in turn the suited man

would come around though ready the same

one twice Rey would sign some papers in

my former house sibling would head out

the door and into the wide world I

didn't see them after that but at the

time I didn't really think anything of

it I assumed they were too busy trying

to survive in a world that I had always

considered deeply hostile Agnes came to

the house two months before my birthday

in the middle of winter Rae had never

mentioned her never held one of his

little meetings to introduce her she was

just suddenly in the house one day and

no one really thought to question it she

was younger than the other kids maybe

ten or eleven years old didn't talk much

she had a small sharp face and long

brown hair always braided into two tight

pigtails which she would twirl around

her fingers whenever you tried to talk

to her I'll admit she was a bit spooky

looking back on it but to be honest at

the time I never really questioned it

the same way I never really questioned

any of it she never came to church

though never sat around the dinner table

when it was uncovered whenever Rae came

in the room and she was in there he

would often just turn around and leave

at once

I could have sworn that he looked at her

with something in his eyes that even in

my dull state I recognized a severe I

was so focused on my upcoming

emancipation that I didn't pay much

attention to these developments and I

can't tell you much more about Agnes or

what she did with her time in the house

all I know is that when the man from the

Children's Committee came with the

papers for raid a sign she was standing

at the bottom of the stairs watching me

with an expression that looked almost

playful Rae signed the documents to

remind me fully back to state custody

the age of majority back then was

twenty-one but from eighteen I was

expected to be finding work and

accommodation on my own

it was all a bit surreal watching pens

signed my life into its different stages

without holding any of them myself as

the man in the suit told me to follow

him and a clipped BBC accent echinus

walked over and gestured for me to lean

down and listen to her I did so but

instead of a conspiratorial whisper he

just gave me a quick kiss on the cheek

then ran off down the hall I stood there

for a moment confused for my temporary

guardian once again instructed me to

follow him I did so and the cold air of

the outside hit me like a slap across

the face

we walked for a few minutes to the end

of the road and I felt as though my

meager suitcase was almost frozen to my

hand he told me to wait there while he

brought his car around then disappeared

down a side street

I stood there as the bitter wind cut

through my thin coat the Sun was out but

it didn't do much to soften the

sharpness of the February air as I

waited then without warning I wasn't

waiting anymore I had turned around put

down my suitcase and started walking

back toward Raymond Fielding's house I

didn't want to go back I had no reason

to go back but I had apparently decided

to anyway because I knew that's where I

was going after two and a half years I

was rather used to this feeling but

there was something else there this time

something in the back of my mind her

frantic scuttling terror it didn't do

any good though I was returning to

hilltop Road no matter what I might feel

about him Joyce didn't even come into it

the door was unlocked when I returned in

the house was quiet my eyes darted

around looking for anyone who might be

able to tell me what was going on

why the fine threads that pulled me

through my life had dragged me back here

but I was alone I walked over to the

door that led down into the basement

into Ray's study and I was suddenly

struck by the realization that nobody

other than him had ever gone inside at

least not to my knowledge

nonetheless I reached up and turned to

the hand

twisted silently and the door swung open

revealing a set of stairs leading down

light bulbs in spherical lampshades lit

the way and the thought struck me that

given how much time ray spent down here

it was surprising how many cobwebs there

were they covered every corner and

lightly coated part of the walls as I

headed down the stairs closing the door

behind me I saw even more who came to

the unsettling realization that were

covered the bare bulbs were not in fact

lampshades but were instead thick clumps

of cobweb the sight that greeted me when

I finally reached the bottom of the

stairs was about as far from what I had

expected as it could possibly have been

rather than a study filled with books

papers desks or the like the room was

large an almost empty the walls and

ceiling were bare earth and it looked

more like a burrow than anything else in

the center of the room stood that

strange hypnotic table though how he had

gotten the heavy wooden thing down here

was beyond me the whole place was

covered with a thick gossamer of

spider's web and in the thick clumps

around the edges of the chamber I saw

shapes i recognised doris hardy dick

Barrow Dale Greg Montgomery the older

ones who had left the house before i had

they lay still now wrapped in their

sticky cocoons their bodies seemed

warped and bloated in a way I didn't

recognize but that's only because at

that point in my life I had never before

seen a spider egg sac in the chair sat

Raymond of fielding he looked the same

as ever

that Placid unreadable smile still on

his face his brown leather coat seems to

shift around his body the texture and

the dim light seemed more like course

for her he didn't say anything just

watched as I continued to make my way

towards the table for all the terror

strangling my heart at that moment at

the discovery of the grotesque fate of

my friends I could still feel the bland

uncaring expression of my face and found

myself stood in front of the table as

though nothing whatsoever was wrong I

reached over and pulled with the wooden

square from the center of the table on

its own it appeared to be a small wooden

box and the lid opened smoothly as my

hands moved in a practiced motion inside

was an apple green and fresh and still

wet with morning dew I knew I was going

to eat it

I could feel tears desperately trying to

push themselves out of my eyes but I

instead decided not to cry I placed the

Box down on the table reached over and

picked up the Apple all at once my cheek

erupted in pain it was like someone

depressed a hot branding iron into my

face and I could swear that I heard the

flesh sizzle as I let how to scream and

fell to my knees I raised my hands to my

face and realized in that moment two

very important things the first is that

my face seemed to be untouched

I could feel no injury or burn the

second was that raising my hand had been

a truly voluntary act I had willed it

myself and whatever power had been

gripping me tugging me into its web I

was free of it I looked at Raymond

Fielding whose face finally had a real

expression on it one of confusion and

anger as he stood up I saw small

twitching shapes tumbling out of his

jacket and I ran I ran up those stairs

out the door and away into the night I

didn't look back unto this day I pray

every night but the others down in the

basement were already dead that's it

really within two hours I was out of

Oxford on the first train I could jump

onto I jumped off at Birmingham to avoid

a ticket inspector and that's where I

spent the next several years given my

start in life I've done very well for

myself I now have comfort education and

money I try to think that I've left my

past behind but that sort of denial

doesn't help me sleep I only had my

first truly restful night since that day

after reading about the fire that burned

the house to the ground

but now they're building there they're

breaking ground that should be left

burned and empty and I've started to

dream again statement ends mr. Sinclair

was not exaggerating when he described

the difficulties of tracking down

information on any youth halfway house

in hilltop Road all Raymond Fielding

more generally while I am naturally

inclined to suspect conspiracy not in

informs me that the nature of the gaps

look like lost or damaged files there

are whole swathe of records missing from

that period not only related to fielding

but many other similar institutions in

the area there's no attempt to cover up

or redirect it either it just looks like

whichever cabinet housed those records

got lost or damaged in the years since I

have done my best to prevent martin

reading this statement in too much

detail I have no interest in having

another argument about spiders in fact

after reading this statement I have no

interest in thinking about spiders any

more than is professionally required it

raises further questions about the

relationship between Raymond Fielding in

this Agnes I can only hope some answers

lie elsewhere in the archives I wouldn't

be surprised

between Ronald Sinclair, Ivo Lensik, and Father Burroughs, it appears there's still much to learn about Hilltop Road.

Supplemental.

Everyone's avoiding me. They've taken to working farther away from me than normal, and when I call them for any reason, they're always keen to leave as soon as possible. They share furtive glances when they think I'm not looking. I don't like it. I feel like they're planning something.
