statement of cart at Chilcott regarding

his time spent in isolation aboard the

space station Daedalus in September 2007

original statement given April 4 2009

audio recording by jonathan sims head

archivist of the Magnus Institute London

statement begins we're all alone out

there I know the statistics how big the

universe is the probabilities and

proximity z' and the promises of other

beings out there among the stars but

I've been there there's nothing nothing

but empty uncaring void lasing dead

worlds and dead stars all together like

a tapestry of lonely meaninglessness

humans have existed for the smallest

sliver of a fraction of a moment in the

existence of the universe and we will be

extinguished just as widely and when we

are at last gone forever into the quiet

emptiness of death there will be nothing

left but the cold universe and nothing

shall mark our passing because there is

nothing to do so dismiss me if you wish

to take comfort in your escapist

fantasies of aliens and visitors from

other worlds but there's no proof I can

give you beyond the testimony of one who

has spent so very long staring into that

black and empty infinity and knowing

truly knowing what it means to be

floating and forsaken in an empty

universe I knew isolation experiments

could be rough when I signed up

I'm not some naive fool who thought he'd

injure a few quirky side effects for

science no I'm an astronaut so I do my

research when I was picked for the

project a long-term isolation study set

in conditions of low Earth orbit I read

up on as many previous cases and similar

experiments from the past 30 years

familiarizing myself with

side effects and likely psychological

hurdles it was daunting to say the least

I wasn't keen to experience some of what

the previous tests seemed to promise

what happened to my mind but I didn't

feel like I had much choice I'd had my

application to the International Space

Station floating in limbo for so long

that when a private consortium

approached me telling me they'd recently

launched Daedalus a small man satellite

of their own and needed qualified crew

members I jumped at the chance to go to

space

at last I should have realized that what

they meant by crew member was lab monkey

but to be honest even after I found this

out it didn't do a lot to dampen my

enthusiasm for the project I was going

to space there were two other people

technically on the crew I say

technically as I never spent any time

with them beyond the trip up to the

Daedalus their names were yang Kilbride

and Manuela Dominguez I'm sure that they

probably did a lot more looking after

the station than I ever did but as far

as I was concerned I was the only one up

there

from the chattaroy her before the

mission began each of us had an

experiment of our own to be concerned

with but they were also there as a

backup in case something went horribly

wrong with mine since the observing

scientist simply didn't have the option

of intervening themselves I remember the

man in charge of my particular project

Conrad Lucas made a face of rather

overstated disgust when he told me I

wouldn't be up there entirely on my own

I got the distinct impression he was one

of those people who feel that ethical

restrictions do nothing but bind the

hands of the true scientist and leave

them at the mercy of their subjects

limitations my section of the tiny space

station was completely self-contained

there was food sleeping arrangements and

zero-gravity exercise equipment all for

my personal use the single entrance to

the rest of the satellite was locked and

sealed it could be open from either side

but on my side it required a code I did

have access to the code in case of

emergency but I had way too much riding

on the mission to even think about being

responsible for its early termination I

also had one large domed window it

allowed me a decent view of the earth

below as well as

plenty of chance to stare off into space

which I did quite a lot in those early

days I was told the other astronauts

would do their best to avoid that window

while doing maintenance or repair work

outside Mission Control had also

supplied me with a lot of books and

films and other entertainments as like

Conrad had told me at the first briefing

the experiment was into isolation not

boredom so when I locked that door for

the first time I was feeling in pretty

good spirits about the whole thing to be

honest I knew I was being monitored

there was a little camera mounted on the

wall that kept a beady eye on me it

wasn't so invasive that I couldn't get

away from it when I wanted to but for

the most part I was happy enough to eat

and read and exercise in front of the

watchful lens obviously those assessing

my progress would never communicate with

me directly and they might not even be

watching a live feed so if they had

opinions on how I was undertaking my

task I never heard them even if my task

was just sitting around in a room in

space waiting for my mind to break I

tried not to take too much comfort in

the knowledge that there were people

watching my every move as I felt that to

find that reassuring would go quite

strongly against the spirit of the

experiment I had to really feel alone

that at least it didn't take too long to

set in I can't honestly see how

strapping yourself into sleep or

drinking your juice with a space foil

pack on the straw can have much effect

on isolation but I wasn't going to be

the one to bring it up I believe some

people would have been more disturbed

than others by its location orbiting

earth but it didn't feel markedly

different to me from any of the other

isolation studies they conducted over

the last few decades if anything the

silent rolling green and blue of the

earth far below was another source of

comfort in the sure knowledge of the

billions of other people making their

way through life who had no idea what

was right above their heads

both of these comforts lasted me almost

six weeks that was when I was aware I

should start to experience some of the

more distressing side-effects

I'd already passed through listlessness

and a bout of insomnia

I hadn't been using my exercise machine

properly for almost a fortnight

but I still didn't expect the severity

of the hallucinations when they began

twice I was woken up by the sound of the

door opening I need to find it as tight

as it had ever been throughout the

daytime I would occasionally hear

footsteps which shouldn't even have been

possible in zero gravity there was also

a blackout for about 20 minutes at one

point that may or may not have been real

certainly we didn't seem to lose power

in any other systems except the lights

so this was all Greece he'll be

distressing but at least it had the

advantage of not being unexpected the

first warning I got about how bad things

were going to get was the spacesuit the

clocks read it as 1430 UTC and I was

rewatching 28 days later one of the

better films that had been provided for

my entertainment when a movement in the

window caught my eye at first I thought

it might have been some orbital debris

moving past but and I spotted it still

at the edge of the domed window it was a

hand the white bulky gloved hand of

someone wearing a navy a suit it started

to float slowly across the window

followed by the rest of the arm then the

torso till almost the whole suit slowly

floating across I was excited by the

idea of seeing another human being at

first even if it was only brief or might

compromise some of the work but as the

suit made it's painstaking drift across

the space outside it rotated enough that

I could see clearly through the suits

visor there was nobody inside the

floating suit was completely empty

and I started to suddenly get very

scared at last did it passed right

across and off into the night the other

side and I stopped try and calm myself

in the face of what had been a deeply

strange thing to watch I managed to do

so but only until I looked again out of

that window there were no more empty

floating clothes but I noticed something

that for some reason hadn't dawned on me

when watching the empty suit it was to

put it quite simply impossible and I

must have approached it from a hundred

different angles trying to make sense of

it the earth was gone

third first I assumed it must have been

an orientation change but that didn't

make any sense the planet below had

never been hidden from my position

before and if we shifted that radically

I would have felt it I was sure but

still the fact remained that where the

earth should have been there was empty

dark space must have watched for hours

waiting to see the Sun we were

definitely still moving and from what I

could tell we still seemed to be moving

in some sort of orbit but without a

planet below I have no idea why we kept

the same pattern regardless the Sun

should have been visible sooner or later

after two days of waiting I finally

accepted the Sun and the moon had gone

as well it wasn't completely empty out

there far off in the distance I could

still see stars twinkling probably long

dead but I knew that there was nothing

they could do to save me at some point

on the first day I remembered the camera

I focused my attention on it and began

to scream and shout for help in the vain

hope that someone might be watching a

feed of it and be able to make contact I

cried and begged and pleaded with that

camera for almost four hours before I

was suddenly struck by a terrif

I thought I floated over to it and

gently took hold of the cables that are

fed out from the back into the wall I

followed them along looking for where

they connected the power or broadcasting

apparatus what I found instead were a

pair of neatly severed wires

transmitting nothing

powering nothing connected to nothing

the camera had never even been turned on

and had certainly not been transmitting

anything to earth so what dates were

they been collecting I still have no

idea the answer to that question but I

did feel like I gained some small sliver

of control back after spending an

all-too-brief hour smashing up the

camera after that it was time to break

out the code and get the door to the

rest of the satellite open I had decided

that even if this somehow was simply a

really elaborate and convincing trick to

examine reactions to certain stimulus in

a test environment it was still far

beyond what I had signed up for one way

or another I decided I was getting out

of this damned experiment I opened the

small safe that contained the passcode

document and easily broke the seal on

its container

I was desperate to get out of that door

as soon as possible and took a few

moments to memorize it e10 9g ht8 I can

still remember it vividly as I entered

that code over and over in an attempt to

get that locked door to open each time I

painstakingly ended it with as much

precision as I still had within me and

each time the password field read out

what I had apparently typed in no one is

coming

and the door remained closed and that

was it I was trapped alone in a tiny

room floating in space

deserted empty space I had plenty of

food and water so starvation wasn't a

danger but sometime in the first week

the clock stopped working with no

timepiece and nothing left outside of

the Sun or moon keeping any sort of time

at all became utterly impossible if I

had to guess how long I spent in that

strange exile I would say somewhere

between three and six months but that is

based solely on my eating and sleeping

patterns which were largely fueled by

despair and that quiet aching terror of

being utterly forsaken I couldn't even

read my books or watch anything as

characters seemed dead and lifeless the

emptiness of their artificial existence

made plain to me the hallucination

stopped I did not even get the comfort

of company in my delusions though at

some point the line between dreaming and

reality seems to blur I'll be sleeping

strapped into my bed in the middle of

the void or at the same time floating

through ancient graveyards or the open

empty sea they weren't

hallucinations though they were dreams

even if the cold did seem to seep out of

them and into the bones of me I spent so

long trying to get that door open but

nothing worked the mechanisms and

electronics were not accessible from my

side when I finally stopped trying it

was the final abandoning of my hope that

was also when I noticed something else

that alarmed me in a very different way

I did some calculations and realized

that my food and water levels did not

seem to be depleting for all the time I

had been there in what I could now only

think of as my imprisonment it did not

seem like there had been any significant

change in my supplies no one could be

restocking me because there was no one

but me there

the food remained static then did that

mean I could remain trapped in this

place for the rest of my life assuming I

even still aged I began to very

seriously consider the idea that I had

died and this was hell

given that worry the way I finally

escaped it could be considered ironic i

starved myself to death

well not to death I suppose given I'm

alive enough to talk to you but close

enough I don't know how long I just

floated there strapped into my lonely

cocoon of a bed refusing to eat or drink

and waiting for the end after everything

else I had no guarantee it was even

possible for me to die but I had to try

when I finally faded from consciousness

for what I hoped was the last time it

was the greatest relief I have ever felt

I don't know exactly when I realized I

wasn't dead there were various moments I

faded back into consciousness and I know

that I felt the re-entry very hard but

is difficult to pin down clear thoughts

before the hospital no-one's really

given me an official account of what

happened aside from that it became known

I was in serious danger of death and my

colleagues on the daedalus retrieved me

and managed to keep me alive until the

next opportunity to send me back down

I'm not pushing to no more not really I

know what happened and no rational cover

story that they could feed me is going

to change it I haven't followed up with

Conrad and as far as I'm aware he hasn't

made any attempt to contact me I was

paid in full though which was a surprise

I wanted to tell someone what really

happened for almost a year before I

found your Institute there's nothing

really to be done about it

I wanted to get it off my chest so thank

you for letting me get it down on paper

statement ends while there's plenty of

media coverage of the launch of the

Daedalus satellite in early 2007 by

stratosphere group a consortium of

various scientific and aerospace

companies it seems the actual operate

of the facility is guarded with a great

deal more secrecy by the various

organizations involved martin was able

to confirm that during its two years of

operation it did have a total of three

staff on board yan killbride Manuela

Dominguez and mr. Chilcott beyond that

however there's little that can be

retrieved from beyond the wall of

corporate bureaucracy Tim was however

able to get a list of the businesses

involved in the venture three names

stand out pinnacle aerospace majority

owned by the Fairchild family a large

private investment by nathaniel lukas

and optic solutions limited a relatively

benign seeming company manufacturing

specialist cameras for research and

industrial application who are

nonetheless notable for having their

business address listed as being in

neeyala sond in norway i fear however

that's as much digging as i can do at

the moment without drawing attention so

it may be wise to let the matter drop

and recording John what are you doing I

I can't seem to find a new file for the

hilltop Road case I thought I gave it to

you to follow up on the children you did

and I gave it back even if I hadn't I

would very much prefer it if you stay

out of my desk oh of course

sorry I didn't realize you were still

here or I would have asked of course

I'll see if it's with Tim then also John

I have asked before what please don't

record our conversations

stupid

I thought Sasha had left the evening 

I wanted to have a look in her desk for anything that might shed light on her recent weird behavior 

I didn't get much of a chance but it all looked normal

except her

there are a few scraps of torn paper 

they could be from files or just torn scrap paper 

it's hard to tell 

I'm at a loss why she would want to destroy files

though still I think I probably need to back off from Sasha for a while after this 

I'll just keep an eye from a distance for now 

I did find several pictures of her and her new boyfriend, though, which puts my mind somewhat at ease

well, mostly

there's something about him that doesn't seem quite right. 

something about the smile, maybe. 

I, I mean they're all pictures of Sasha and Tom, as I'm told his name is, having fun together, but - it's hard to put into words, exactly, but every one of them looks somehow like a stock photo.

End supplement.
