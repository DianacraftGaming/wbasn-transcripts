I've just touched her in our hair

International Airport following up on

the address I received from Xiaoling

apparently they were staying in West

Pullman Chicago at least they were when

Gertrude requested the statements

forwarded on to them I'm going to get a

hotel and follow up the address tomorrow

I wouldn't normally bother recording

here but I think I thought I was being

followed I might just be jumpy I'll keep

my eyes peeled the address didn't really

pan out the place deals in short-term

rentals and a dozen people must have

gone through that apartment since

Gertrude and Jared stayed there the

owner did remember her that old Brit and

her son but he said anything they left

behind was either sold or thrown out

they did leave a forwarding address of

sorts anything that came was to be sent

on to the Usher foundation in Washington

DC who I assume would send it on to the

Magnus Institute I asked him about

circuses around at the time and he said

he didn't remember there being one but a

few nights while Gertrude was there he

had heard music like one of those little

organs coming from West Borman Park I'm

planning to make the journey down to

Washington in the hopes that Gertrude

might have visited the usher foundation

according to our earlier emails they

don't have any record of it on file but

I did notice however the one of the

Greyhound roots there goes through

Pittsburgh now according to the details

Melanie retrieved a few months back

Pittsburgh is where Jared kee allegedly

died he was admitted to UPMC

Presbyterian emergency department having

suffered a massive seizure and died less

than a day later I think I might have to

pay a visit and ask around

also I'm definitely being followed

there's a police officer I saw him at

the airport as well he stood out a bit

because he wasn't immigration or TSA or

anything like that he just he just

looked like a Chicago beat cop well I

saw him again today and I'm pretty sure

he was watching me the the hospital was

the hospital was interesting it's all

very well being able to get people to

answer your questions but if they

genuinely don't remember something it's

not always as useful as it seems I only

found one person Louis Brown a nurse who

recalls working the night Jared key was

admitted his mother was with him and I

almost feel like Gertrude took a

perverse joy in the pretense

she explained his condition to the

doctor though could apparently often no

good reason he wasn't in full-time

treatment as his cancer was by this

point very advanced they did everything

they could to save him but he had a

second seizure shortly after he was

admitted and there was nothing they

could do unless he was somehow able to

lie to me

this nurse Lewis honestly believes Jared

key is dead

maybe I came all this way for nothing

there's one thing I very much do need to

follow up on though apparently Gertrude

was arrested shortly afterwards Louis

Oni heard about this secondhand but she

was apparently caught breaking into the

morgue where Jared's body was being kept

I need some sleep I haven't seen a cop

since I left Chicago so maybe I was

wrong I'm not feeling so good

I've been looking into Gertrude's arrest

I couldn't get through to Melanie but

Martin managed to find a few details

online yo Judah was arrested for

trespassing but released shortly

afterwards without being charged I

managed to track down the arresting

officer 1j Rebeck hsihu said that she'd

been found over the body of jerod key

reading from a large strangely shaped

book

they'd been unable to determine if the

mutilations on Jared's body had been

done by her and in the end she somehow

managed to talk them out of pressing

charges

officer Epix didn't remember what she'd

said but he did recall that she never

returned for the book it was sitting in

evidence for almost a year before as far

as Reb --ax was aware it simply vanished

I don't really know what to make of any

of this I'm I'm confused I'm dizzy I

think I saw the police officer from

Chicago again in the station where I was

talking to Rebeck side

I'm not feeling Wow Elias says I got a

letter well an envelope it's it's a

statement there's there's a note to tide

you over

statement of Howard Ewing regarding his

interview with an unidentified member of

British Transport Police original

statement given February 1st 2010 audio

recording by jonathan sims head

archivist of the magnus institute london

statement begins the room is hot it's

small and there are no windows and the

table is sheet metal it shouldn't be so

hot in January but I think maybe they've

just got the heating turned up too high

when I rest my arm on the table too long

I can see the patches of sweat on the

smooth surface as I lift them up again

I've asked for water so many times and

he always says it's coming but it hasn't

come yet he just sits there he's wearing

the uniform of the British Transport

Police three pips on his shoulder but he

won't show me his badge he won't show me

any ID why are they doing this I didn't

do anything the officers that brought me

here were friendly kind it was only

after they left in it got so hot and he

started sitting across from me he's

smiling asking me questions again and

again what were you doing earlier

tonight my job I was doing my job

cleaning more gate station me and Kelly

and VN with a night cleanness and that's

what we were doing we'd done the ticket

office and the corridors and the

entrances and we were getting started on

the platforms why is that so hard for

him to understand he laughs and I winced

as sweat drops into my eye when did you

first notice something was wrong we had

just started work on the platform itself

when we heard the tannery come on I

don't know how as far as I knew it

wasn't even powered but there was that

slight crackle and then this is a

security announcement we all waited

confused but what came out next sounded

muffled but he was coming up through

five feet of water I couldn't make out

any of the words and from the looks on

their faces neither could my colleagues

we strange to listen but after a few

seconds it was silent again we all

looked at each other and the hands

started to shrug when there came an

incredible shrieking noise from the

speakers it felt like needles through my

eardrums and it was all I could do to

stay upright I saw Kelly fall to the

floor clutching her head then it stopped

completely and we all looked at each

other again catching our breath trying

to figure out who to report this to and

how how did he become aware of the Train

the first thing I noticed was the smell

even before the noise or the heat there

was a sticky greasy smell in the air

like burning chemicals and spoiled bacon

I tries to figure out where it was

coming from and I realized it got

stronger the closer to the tunnel mouth

I moved by the time I reached the end of

the platform

I was almost gagging the others looked

like they had mostly recovered from the

screeching tannoy and were noticing my

odd movements and came over to

investigate themselves I saw the hand

pull a face as he approached and I

pointed weakly to the opening of the

tunnel I carefully climbed down onto the

tracks and looked out into the dark that

led to old Street that's when I saw it

what did the carriage look like it was

hard to tell through the flames they

were all over it

curling and writhing and crawling

through the crevices in the wreckage

it wasn't intact though parts of it were

clearly crumpled and broken and I saw

shards of steel and glass embedded in

the wall that was lit by the dim red

flames what did it look like there were

people still inside I could see them

arms and heads reaching out of broken

windows and split metal blackened and

rendered almost unrecognizable by the

fire in the heat

but they still moved and twitched and

cried out in pain and terror scratching

at the edge of their burning metal tomb

but everything was choked and surrounded

by a thick acrid black smoke that

stunned my eyes and lungs so nothing

seemed the same from one moment to the

next what did it look like

it looked like hell what did you hear

everything for tunnel echoed and

funneled the sounds until I could hear

every agonized cry every pop and crackle

of the fire the groaning of metal that

matched the groaning of the wounded and

the dying it all hit me at once

by the tunnel was pushing the tidal wave

of sound out just for me the shape was

perfect for a terrible screaming oven

from behind me I heard the shouts of

Kelly and Rehan though I don't know if

it was because they saw it too

or because they saw me fall to my knees

in horror I could hear the tannoy again

now clearly speaking will Inspector Sanz

please report will inspect her sands

please report over and over again he

smiles and the tiny room gets hotter

who is inspector sands it's a code

one of the codes we use to alert staff

to situations of disaster or fire it

usually means there's a fire it's to

keep people calm it's meant to not cause

any panic keep them safe even if there's

an emergency he laughs and I wish I

could go home how many people were on

the train I don't know what sort of

train carriage was it I don't know where

did it come from I don't know did you

scream yes at least I think so the back

of my throat was dry and hot and painful

so my mouth must have been open I think

I was screaming what were your

colleagues doing the hand was gripping

me by the shoulders shaking me yelling

at me to wake up but I was awake I was

wide awake and I think in some ways he

was talking to himself clearly was

walking past me trying to battle through

the choking rancid smoke I hope she was

planning to try and rescue those trapped

in the wreckage but maybe she was simply

trying to join them I couldn't do

anything to help either of them and I

knew that if I touched them I would burn

them

he inhales as if in triumph and where

are they now they're dead at least

that's what I was told when the officers

brought me here they found no wreckage

nothing in the tunnels no corpses

wailing through an underground Inferno

just the dead and burnt bodies of Kelly

Dwyer and V Han Prasad what do you love

most in the world the question sends a

shock through my whole body I know this

is what he wants all he truly cares

about I want to lie to say that I love

nothing and nobody that I am alone in

the world and he'll have to look

elsewhere my tongue burns in my mouth as

I try to keep it still what do you love

most in the world my father I love my

father more than anything Who am I I

don't answer and he lets me leave

my father is dead a week later a heart

attack at the age of 63 everyone is

surprised and saddened but not shocked I

tried to tell myself it's a coincidence

that a heart attack is the most natural

death in the world but at the funeral

despite arranging it myself

despite selecting the burial plot and

the headstone i watch as they take my

father off for cremation and nobody can

tell me why they simply say how sorry

they are for my loss and hand me my

father's ashes I don't want his hashes I

know he'll be back the policeman with

three bright pips on his shoulder and

he'll ask me what else I love and I'll

tell him then he'll ask me who he is and

I won't say I don't want to cause any

panic statement ends I'm going to bed I

feel a lot better

I'd love to rattle off a list of

potential are the reasons for this nice

rational causes of recovery but I think

we're past the point of transparent

rationalizations it looks like the

recording of statements is now passed

over from psychological compulsion into

a more physical dependence I don't know

whether this is some sort of classical

addiction or something a bit deeper but

either way this is not the time for

experimentation I on a deadline and if I

need to be reading statements to stay

well enough and I suppose that's what I

shall do what irritates me most is that

Elias was clearly aware of this hence

his sending me this which seems to serve

no other purpose but as a restorative

but as usual

he chose to keep this very useful

information to himself I think I've

reached another dead end here I've

decided it's the last one the Institute

needs me they're not jetting around the

world following a cold trail that may

well not have led to anything we useful

the first time I've a greyhound booked

down to Washington DC tomorrow I'm going

to stop in at the Asha foundation just

in case they have anything that might

help and then I'm flying home I had a

rest stop the the buses there they're

giving us a comfort break but there's

there's a woman here in the cafe the

diner whatever I've seen her car I think

she's following the bus she's early 30s

I think dressed nondescript hard wearing

denim old leather

she is definitely watching me she

doesn't look like she's coming over I

think

hello can I help you sure whatever

you're reaching for don't I what keep

your hands on the table and we can all

walk away from this you're English

so are you ah hands on the table

you so who are you Oh Jonathan did John

Simms are I'm the head archivist for the

Magnus Institute London oh you don't say

so what brings you down to the i-70

Pennsylvania look I mean you weren't

following me who told you were asking

some interesting questions around a few

places back in Pittsburgh and you seem

to have attracted the attention of

something we've been watching for a

while my bus is leaving you aria

then try to run go on

so kidnapped again think of it like an

escort personal bodyguard you're heading

librarian stories the Mars will just fly

on my gut so this old woman about my dad

spell half of it but really helped me

put the pieces together you know I'm

starting to hmm you still haven't told

pond or why you're asking around about
