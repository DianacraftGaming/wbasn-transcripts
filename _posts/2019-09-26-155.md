any luck no they're still around they're

staying hidden no there's any shortage

of places to lay low hmm London's what

600 square miles 607 or whatever so I

guess want to look out for a pair of

homeless serial killers now I'll add it

to the list

no sign of Annabelle either you still on

that you're not I mean I don't know how

much he can predict or manipulate the

future but I think she's proven she's at

least avoid us finding her yeah well it

makes me feel better

I suppose that something how's Daisy I

don't know she was recovered from your

little confrontation but she's still

getting weaker I'm worried she why did

you call her and not me

honestly I panicked her name came up

first on my phone I'm trying to convince

let's go after them to uh hunt them why

because I'm not going to lose her she

goes hunting again you might anyway and

if she doesn't she might die something

you're fine with in certain other cases

and something she's made peace with

because of the guilt she feels over the

stuff the hunt made her do it's not her

fault

earlier when she was still out of it I I

saw some of the things she was talking

about some of the things she did while

she was please I'm not convinced I

disagree with her assessment do you want

me to tell you no no I don't you knew

didn't you

you knew the sort of things she did and

you let her know not exactly

I thought it's not that simple

it never is but that doesn't make it

okay none of us are who we were John no

I suppose not in many ways it's simpler

now isn't it at least now our demons

have names

have you thought any more about what I

said yeah I don't think I can

Daisy wouldn't come if I didn't and I'm

not leaving her behind besides both of

us being blind would be anyway being

stuck here isn't exactly her main

problem right now I suppose not

with those Hunters still out no I

understand just wanted to make sure you

knew you had the choice yeah anyway I

should go check on her sure

do you mind closing the door statement

time statement of Topher McHugh

regarding their string of near-death

experiences original statement given

December 3rd 2002 audio recording by

Jonathan Simms the archivist statement

begins you've got to understand I have

so much to live for

oh okay that's not quite it I know most

people have plenty to live for but what

I mean is that my life does good I put a

lot into the world

did you read rap that homelessness

initiative that got 8,000 people into

shelters that was me

I've financed drug projects organized

inner city violence initiatives I've

always been so aware of the position I'm

in and keen to use that power to

actually help people now that's not

money from some trust fund

I mean sure my parents loaned me the

money to start I built my business up

from the ground and we now provide jobs

for almost 700 people and I know that

everyone's life has value but I just

need to be clear that my impact on the

world is a positive one my existence

does a lot of good and that's only

gotten more true since all this started

I've given more spent more time on

charitable stuff and helped more people

sorry I'm just aware of how this story

makes me look and I don't want you to

think I'm some selfish monster grinding

people up just to extend my own ghoulish

life I'm trying to do good

I've always tried to live a healthy life

never smoked or did drugs washing my

diet got plenty of exercise so when I

had an epileptic seizure the first one

of my entire life the month before my

wedding that wasn't fair I mean even if

I had to have epilepsy which I could

live with having my first attack at the

top of a staircase five weeks before the

happiest day of my life that's just not

fair there was no reason for it I'd done

everything right it shouldn't have

happened like that

I remember the odds tingling feeling

rising up from my stomach through my

lungs until it hit my head I've never

felt anything like it I didn't know what

to do and even if I had I don't know if

I could have done it in time

I don't remember falling exactly just

the world spinning and moving around me

as I remained absolutely still there

were these cracks like gunshots in my

head though even now I don't know if

that was part of the seizure or how my

mind process to the breaking bones then

I was on the ground looking back up the

stairs and thinking to myself how

strange it was that I wasn't there

I'd been stood just there so why

couldn't I see myself everything seemed

very loud then very quiet then very

bright the last thing I saw was a man

rushing to help he was wearing a t-shirt

with a silly little cartoon alien on it

and I thought was that from an advert

and then I went away you know it's

strange I'd never really feared death

I'm agnostic was agnostic and always

thought that if there was a God then

he'd to know what was in your heart and

if you'd lived a good life then you'd be

all right

but more likely I thought it would be

nothing no heaven or hell no thought or

sensation just nothing

you wouldn't even notice you were gone

but it wasn't like that at all I don't

know if I have words for it how can you

describe being aware of the absence of

everything life light warmth it was very

dark and very cold it dawned on me that

this might be my existence forever there

beyond time and I tried so desperately

to scream but I had no lungs or throats

in that dreadful place

I couldn't even cry then I was back in

the light with such a sudden jolt that I

found myself trying to blink even though

I had no eyelids or even eyes but I

could still see I was standing in what

seemed to be an operating theatre

doctors and nurses in scrubs and masks

buzzed around and threw me busy with

something on the long table in the

center of the room it didn't take me

long to realize that what they were busy

with was me

I didn't look like myself so bruised and

discolored with a great gash on my

forehead is it odd to say that this

sight filled me with relief there was a

sudden rush of realization I wasn't dead

I was having a near-death experience I'd

read about people having encounters

almost exactly like this one and they

had seemed fine I might still be okay I

might live then I became aware of a long

steady droning sound my vision turned to

the flat unmoving line on the heartrate

monitor

the panic I felt before returned all at

once but now focused acute I didn't have

any arms but still I tried to reach out

flailing towards the doctor who was

leaning over my body

trying to restart my heart and then I

felt something I felt myself reach into

his chest

held the strong steady beat of his heart

calm calm while I was lying dead on the

table there was a sudden moment of rage

and hate that flowed out of me down at

his torso

he began to convulse he staggered

backwards from the table arms dropping

to his side struggling to speak

I heard the drone of the monitor turning

to a beep beep beep I was gone when I

woke up I was lying in a hospital bed

very much alive although the faces

around me were grave I asked her what

had happened and one of the nurses very

kindly explained to me about the seizure

my fall and what my recovery might look

like going forward but I could tell she

was holding something back

and after some pressing she finally told

me that the doctor who saved my life had

suffered a fatal heart attack while he

was treating me I didn't tell her about

what I saw what I was trying to convince

myself was a simple dream a bizarre

near-death experience I couldn't have

killed him it wasn't possible but there

was no point to putting that thought out

into the world anyway I just had to try

and forget my recovery time was nothing

short of miraculous within a couple of

days I was out of hospital and my broken

bones all seemed to be clean breaks that

healed very fast in the end we didn't

even need to delay the wedding and

despite everything it was perfect

the church was magnificent the reception

the most fun I've had in years and daven

was exactly the man I wanted to spend

the rest of my life with in lieu of

gifts we asked people to donate to a

local children's charity and they sent

us a wonderful thank-you card

we honeymooned in the Caribbean and

everything was right with the world it

was a year later that I slipped in the

shower and cracked my head on the tap I

hadn't had any further seizures and in

fact the doctors haven't be able to find

any trace of epilepsy in my scans at all

no this was simply a freak accident

could have happened to anybody but it

happened to me again I found myself in

that dark cold place and this time I

simply waited hoping against hope that

this time it wouldn't be forever and to

my great relief it wasn't again I found

myself present over my own body a

severed presence watching as the water

continued to beat down on my unmoving

form I was starting to develop a

suspicion a vague idea of what might be

going on there was no one else around

davin was on a business trip and I was

alone in the house

I tried to move and I could it almost

felt like walking though I had no legs

to carry me unable to touch the bathroom

door I simply moved through it then out

into the world looking for something I

couldn't quite name perhaps that doctor

had not been an accident perhaps his

death and my life had been one and the

same did I have to do it again the idea

appalled me to my core but it seemed the

only explanation I had to live I

couldn't die not then we were on the

verge of closing a deal that would

provide fresh water to impoverished

communities in a dozen developing

countries without me it would fall

through

so I kept moving senses attuned to what

I needed and I found her sitting in a

park all on her own

an old woman frail and shivering staring

out of the ducks over the water empty

bread bag by her side if only I could

have explained it to her I'm sure she

would have understood she might even

have agreed I couldn't talk to her

I needed to live she was found dead of a

stroke and I woke up in my shower with a

splitting headache

I thought I'd solved it if anything else

like that happened I knew what I needed

to do but when I began to have a fatal

allergic reaction during a lunch date

only two weeks later despite having no

allergies previously I realized I had

miscalculated perhaps it was life itself

that I was taking and the old woman that

had hardly any left in her and it had

run out too fast this time I sought out

a homeless man young strong though his

life was clearly over as he tried to

destroy himself through drinking I

followed him into an alley and his liver

gave out just at the moment the EpiPen

was pushed into my leg but even that

seems to run out faster than it should

have the car accident was only three

months later and I even found myself

resenting the poor vagrant for not

having more life to sustain me I made a

decision one I am deeply ashamed of but

I honestly thought it was for the best

I couldn't keep living like that in the

shadow of death of what I had to do to

keep going

one sacrifice I thought just one from

someone with their entire life ahead of

them

I took a newborn it's strange the maths

you do of it all a full life ahead of it

but aside from the devastated parents no

real harm to the world as a whole no

good works left unfinished it was a baby

born to poverty one whose life I thought

would bring it pain and I believed it

would be the last I would ever need to

do surely this would be enough surely it

would see me through to the time I was

actually meant to die that I could go

peacefully into oblivion not trapped in

that dreadful darkness they kept me

alive for 10 months still less than the

doctor eventually I realized it had

nothing to do with age or health it was

about connection how joy the more

friends family loved ones the person has

the further out the terror of sudden

death spreads from me the longer it

keeps me alive

I'm 40 now and I have taken the life of

beloved mothers respected professionals

pillars of the community but I have done

so much good with my life I've reached

further helped more people than they

ever could have since this became my

existence I've thrown myself into

philanthropy harder than ever and the

world is so much better for me being in

it

I'm not saying how I live is right or

good but it is the position I have been

put in and a decision I have to make I

never wanted to weigh up the value of a

life to set it on the scales against my

own but that's a choice that I am forced

into and it is one I will continue to

make statement ends what is the value of

a life there's something that can be

quantified put down as numbers good

deeds bad and when your life your

existence is at the cost of doing harm

what then I've I've saved the world the

whole world does that give me the right

to take what I need to survive

I've been reading nothing but these old

dry statements for so long I I feel weak

like I'm fading away do i restrain

myself keep my appetite in check even at

the cost of my life or do I try to

rationalize what I am like there's

McHugh I find myself hating her her

callous self-deception but am I so

different

Daisy's chosen to resist in her own way

knowing full well it might take her life

in the end Melanie - I respect them for

it like I don't know if I can follow

their path I suppose I have a way out

now

one that wouldn't even kill me at least

I hope not

and yet here I am still a my a coward

I just what if they need me

what if oh come in Melanie funny I was

just how are you I'm good

actually oh yeah yeah I am good you

sound like you've made a decision I have

yes right thanks for telling me by the

way

it didn't look like it was easy for you

it wasn't I don't think I don't think it

wants to lose anyone but I thought you

of all people deserve the option yes but

I understand it's a big thing we'll keep

looking

maybe there's another way no John I'm

going to do it I'm quitting oh you're

sure you've thought it through I don't

know if we can look after you you know

afterwards you won't need to I've I've

made a few arrangements and it's going

to be okay honestly I think it is I I

can't be a part of this anymore and if

this is the price then I think I'm okay

to pay it it's it's the rest of you I'm

worried about

we'll be fine always have been

not always

I guess not well if you're sure I won't

be around after this but I'll leave

details in case you need to get in touch

but I understand how are you planning on

doing it got got one of those oils from

the book repair suppliers up in the

library if it can punch through books it

can punch through well it it should do

the trick no reason to try and make it

too complicated I suppose not

I've left a proper resignation letter on

Lucas's desk

it was quite satisfying to write

actually almost made me wish it was

Elias he would have hated for not

serving out my two weeks notice

not sure Lucas even knows who I am

probably for the best

we'll miss you wish I could say the same

yeah do you need any help no I've got

this but if you um if you could in five

minutes

I would appreciate it if you could call

me an ambulance
