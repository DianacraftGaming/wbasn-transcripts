#### ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

I'm sure you know what

open exploring is I'm sure you've had

plenty of amateur Yahoo's in here who

stumble across a ghost in some old

factory so I'll spare you the breakdown

of how it works and if you don't know

what it is well the Internet's a thing

look it up I'm about as close to a

professional as you can get out of

what's basically trespass as a sport

I work as a photographer and if i play

my cards right I can get more money from

an abandoned pump station than from

shooting some spoiled human Barbie for

self-hate monthly or whatever it's

always been me and Luke Nelson

he was my wife's brother and did all the

lighting for our shoots at least until

he was eaten by the darkness last week

that's why I'm here because I didn't

dream that it happened I don't care what

Steph says I don't need to talk to a

shrink I need to talk to you we were

underneath sand Paul's Church in a West

Hackney horrid boxy building really

makes you wonder about God's housing

standards I mean I'm just saying if it

was my house I'd be pretty pissed still

I guess if he didn't want it he should

have protected its predecessor from Nazi

bombs because some poles used to be st.

James before it got blitzed all the way

to rubble everyone always forgets how

much London is under London I mean it's

not as bad as some well I get him bro

where they literally buried half the

city and built a new one on top but some

places it's not too far from it and I'd

been doing a lot of research into some

polls that used to be some James because

it looked like it might be exactly one

such a place

plants have the drainage and underground

of the neighbourhood seemed to indicate

that there was a large subterranean area

directly beneath some poles that

appeared to be avoided by all public

works yet the plans for the modern

Church didn't indicate anything below

ground level

what this told me was that the old

church of San James probably had quite a

sizable underground presence which

hadn't been completely destroyed by the

bombs and which its inheritor didn't use

early to mid 19th century Victorian

vaults undisturbed for 70 years it was

exactly the sort of thing that's in

vogue at the moment with a certain

section of RT magazines and I was sure I

could sell a few to Getty and a handful

of other stock photo sites and hey it

wasn't like I hadn't broken into a

church before luckily some pauls West

Hackney was Church of England meaning

they didn't lock up as tight as some

places Catholic churches can be a real

pain as they actually have some

valuables inside that need to be

protected but this like most CoV was

plain and unadorned inside so while they

took plenty of care with the offices

they weren't so conscientious about

locking up the main church building

there's quite frankly there was nothing

to steal unless you liked him books it

took me in Luke less than a minute to

get inside it was last Tuesday the 25th

I suppose technically it was Wednesday

the 26th as it was well past midnight

when we made our move once we were in we

kept our torches low stowed our

equipment and went looking for anything

that might get us deeper inside but

first it looked like we might have been

mistaken and there was no way beneath

but then Luke spotted what looked like a

removable panel in the floor just off to

the right of what passed for a podium it

was heavier than it looked but after a

bit of work with the crowbar it came off

it didn't look like it had been removed

in decades maybe not since the new

church was built but what surprised me

was the air that came out when it

shifted it hissed like a long held

breath and the air that rose up from

that hole was icy cold and damp not

unexpected but what did surprised me was

how clean it smelled like an autumn

night after the rain

there was no ladder or stairs down but

we'd brought plenty of rope so when we

went the gloom seemed to swallow us I

would have sworn that at times I could

feel it physically pressing against me

as it turned out it was only a couple of

metres down to the floor of the

underground tunnel and our flashlights

showed exactly what I had hoped for old

Victorian brickwork

the passage stretching away from us in

both directions was absolutely perfect

and I wasted no time in setting up a few

shots while Luke placed the lighting

rigs down there the flashes seemed

almost blinding but I was sure I was

getting some excellent shots it was only

when I had a quick glance through them

on the screen of my SLR that I began to

get irritated clearly Luke had been

standing in front of the light when I

had started to shoot in every single

image where the far wall was lit by the

bright lights you could see the clear

shape of a person's shadow I got into

quite an argument with Luke about it he

insisted that he'd never make such a

rookie move I told him that he could

argue with me but not with the camera

eventually he stormed off to go

exploring further on I took another

picture before I followed him the shadow

was still there and it seemed to be ever

so slightly closer I don't know why I

ignored it the human mind is amazingly

adept at ignoring things that don't make

sense that it doesn't want to see I

convinced myself it was a quirk of the

angles of that location

I didn't even let myself entertain the

thought that it could be a problem with

my extremely expensive camera so I

definitely didn't consider the

possibility of a supernatural

explanation

I followed Luke further on until after

about 20 minutes we came to the ruins of

a chamber of some sort the roof had

collapsed probably from the bombing that

had destroyed some James Church and the

rubble blocked off most of it it looked

like it had once been a circular room

and either side of the entrance I could

see doorways blocked with fallen stone

there was no way we'd be able to shift

enough debris to access them but it was

strange as the torch beams played across

them even with most of them completely

covered in collapsed masonry they still

didn't seem as dark as the corridor we'd

come from I took some photos the

composition of the place was excellent

and the block too always had an odd sort

of stark grandeur to them they were

certainly well made if they managed to

survive what looked to be a direct hit

by a German bomb I checked the photos

and there were no shadows

which was

something of a relief we headed back the

other way when we reached our ropes

hanging down from the hole above us Luke

started to have some concerns well I say

concerns he wanted out of there he

wanted us to pack up and climb out and

leave telling me he was getting weird

vibes from the place and was trying to

convince me we'd seen enough looking up

at that bright square lit inviting me

with the moon shining from church

windows I was half tempted to agree with

him the trouble was that due to the

problems with the first shoot I had one

maybe two pictures of equality I could

do anything with and that wasn't nearly

enough I told him bluntly that I didn't

have enough and if I didn't get paid he

didn't get paid

I saw the conflict on his face he wanted

to get out of there sure but apparently

not as much as he wanted to make rent so

on we went further into the tunnel I

don't know how far we went i stopped

every 10 meters or so to set up and try

to get a good picture but the shadows

were back and worse than before now

there'd be two or three of them in some

pictures it wasn't quite as clearly a

human silhouette so I managed to tell

myself that it must be a quirk of how

the tunnel reflected the light even

though looking back that makes no sense

whatsoever still I kept going hoping to

find somewhere where I could get some

shots of the stark gloomy tunnel with

bricks so black they almost looked like

coal we'd move set up shoot check and

then I'd swear at my camera I don't know

how many times we did this Luke got jump

here and jump here the whole way didn't

feel like much more than 10 minutes

we've been doing it but when I checked

my watch we've been down there for

almost two hours we had finally come to

the end of the path and it was just that

an end

a blank wall of bricks indicating the

stopping of the tunnel that seemed to go

under a good deal of hackney at this

point I had last decided to write the

whole thing off and head back it was as

I turned to Luke to tell him this that

my torch died there was no fanfare it

just fizzled for a second then turned

off with a faint pop I looked over to

Luke about to ask him to pass me the

spare batteries when I saw his face I

don't think I've ever seen anyone as

scared as he was at that moment then his

torch went out as well there was nothing

but darkness I could hear him fumbling

for something that I assumed with the

camera lights and a second later I heard

the click click click of him tried to

turn them on nothing happened he kept

clicking the switches on and on I could

feel his desperation but we were still

trapped in the pitch-black

eventually he stopped and we just stood

there I wanted to say something

reassuring to reach out and let him know

I was still there but I was terrified of

breaking the silence there was just his

breathing labored and scared I became

aware of my own breath quick and

betraying the panic I was trying to

pretend I wasn't feeling and then I

heard it the third set of breathing

it was quiet at first long and slow very

deliberate

the more I listen to the louder it

seemed to become as though whoever was

down here with us was making sure we

could hear it and then another set of

breaths joined it deep and throaty and a

fifth a sixth then more we were

surrounded on all sides by the sound of

breathing getting louder getting closer

blue-clad had a small whimper nor

together they stopped in their place

there came a scraping sound something

metal it sounded like being dragged

across the bricks far away behind us but

getting closer and fast it was joined by

a heavy thumping tread footsteps coming

towards us rhythmic and unhurried I

almost thought it could be my heartbeat

pounding in my ears but the echo assured

me it was coming from down the tunnel

then the scraping came again now from

the other direction and I sank to the

floor clutching my camera to my chest

like some sort of protective talisman it

was silent

once again the noise that broke the

stillness this time is the one that is

still ringing in my ears

it was far more dreadful than the others

because of how familiar it was though I

had never heard it in such a manner

before it was Luke's voice and it was a

screaming in agony a shrill

gut-wrenching screech of pain and fear

that wiped away all thought in a second

and replaced it with blind panic I

wanted to run but my legs had locked up

somewhere in my mind

I remembered the flash on my camera and

my fingers instinctively flicked the

switch as I pressed the button the

screaming stopped with a wet snap and

for the worst moment of my life

an explosion of light shot through the

darkness I saw Luke hanging in the air

there was nobody around him but on the

wall in stark black outlines I saw two

long thin shadows standing beside him on

each I saw one spindly arm gripping his

shadow by the shoulders while the other

held up the shadow of his torn off head

in front of me the real one just hung

there dangling as if by some invisible

thread blood dripping onto the body

below it

his eyes were staring at me as though

pleading for my feeble flashing camera

to save him I screamed

the next thing I remember was the

painfully bright light up a dozen

torches on my face it was the rector of

st. Paul's and a small group of what I

assumed to be parishioners he didn't say

a word as he gently led me back towards

the entrance I looked around to see if

Luke's body was there but I knew deep

down that the darkness had eaten him he

was gone

the rector was very understanding though

I wasn't making much sense

he spoke soft words of reassurance

brought me out into the sick pale blue

of dawn and called an ambulance to look

me over I didn't get his name and it was

only after I'd reached the hospital I

realized he had taken my camera since

then I've been under observation in the

hospital nobody listens to my story and

Luke has been officially listed as

missing staff has been very supportive

but I can see the pain in her eyes she

knows I was the last one to see her

brother and it eats at her I don't

really know what to do now except to

keep the lights on statement ends it

should come as no surprise to me by now

that the foundation stone of the

original Church of st. James in West

Hackney was laid on the 17th November

1821 by Sir Robert smirk even so I was

very much hoping to find at least one

architectural oddity lurking beneath the

streets of London that did not bear the

mark of him or his students this

particular encounter doesn't seem to

have much in common with manifestations

from similar buildings we've had

something of a spectrum from him and his

elk cobwebs entombing difficulty in

navigation and now a violent murderous

dark my first thought was the people's

church of the divine hosts as they

seemed to have some affinity to the

darkness but I can find a no connection

of any sort between them and West

Hackney Church or that any of the staff

there were very helpful every one of

them claims to have no memory of

encountering this Gallagher Nelson

despite hospital admission records

clearly stating she was picked up from

there on the morning of the 26th March

2014 Tim is convinced that at least some

of them are lying but there's little we

can do to gain any infamy

they don't wish to volunteer we've been

unable to follow up with miss Gallagher

Nelson all attempts to contact her have

been prevented by her wife Stephanie

Gallagher Nelson who has made it

abundantly clear that we are not welcome

and our to attempt no further contact

Luke Nelson remains missing
