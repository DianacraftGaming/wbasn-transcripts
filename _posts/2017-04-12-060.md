statement of Rosa Maya concerning of

Assistant feeling of being watched

original statement given July 12 1972

audio recording by jonathan sims head

archivist of the magnus institute london

statement begins it's still they're

still watching me there's nowhere I can

go a place I can hide that it doesn't

keep looking at me I don't know why no

idea what it wants from me or if it ever

had any plans beyond just staring from

wherever it is hiding I can't eat I

can't sleep it's been months now and

it's still there you can't see it I know

I can't see it either but that doesn't

matter

because it can't see me that's what

matters

I can feel its gaze burrowing into the

back of my neck does it hate me does it

just want me to keep living in fear I

don't know why this is happening to me

at first I thought it was a person some

stalker who just kept hiding I had this

thought that if I kept feeling something

was watching me then it must be a person

doing it there must be someone following

me it's not like I haven't had stalkers

before I started to scan the faces of

everyone

I passed looking to see if I recognized

them if I'd seen them before anywhere

did I recognize the man in the green

overcoat from the bus this morning did

that bike messenger loop around the road

and pass me again no they never did

never no one was following me but

something was watching it still is a

strange thing is it's a feeling I should

be used to I've been watched by people

for years I present the Look East

segment for BBC News almost every day

well I used to and on the other end of

that camera there were tens of thousands

of people but I never felt it from them

sometimes as I kept my eyes locked on

that camera reeling off the latest

string of burglaries I try to feel it

try to imagine all the people seeing me

watching me even then even when I was

trying it was

never more than a dead empty lens maybe

it's just as well that I never felt it

before I lost my job within two weeks

this feeling coming over me I couldn't

concentrate I couldn't look at the

camera I couldn't read the dead empty

words on the page I ended up having

something of an on-air breakdown

I guess it's lucky you're based in

London so you couldn't have seen it I

know the moment it started looking back

it all seems so arbitrary like a switch

suddenly being clicked on and all at

once my life is destroyed it was three

months ago in April I was doing

inventory for some of my brothers estate

it was largely up to me to take care of

it after his death

my parents were taking it very hard and

weren't well enough themselves to make

the journey down to his small house in

Southampton to try and organize his

meager possessions

I suppose I wasn't in a good place to

begin with you're not meant to die of a

stroke that young I mean he was only 38

and he wasn't exactly the healthiest

buddy it just seemed so unprovoked I've

always been quite religious and believed

that things happened for a reason

blessings ultimately came to the

virtuous in misfortune to the wicked but

now I don't know perhaps you could say

that my curiosity was a fault that

brought this on me but I didn't open the

box because I was curious I opened it

because I had to in order to fully

inventory my dead brother's possessions

I honestly don't think that's a

transgression

it wasn't even marked as special no oak

chests or triple-locked brass boxes just

another brown cardboard box like any

other I don't think that anything about

it struck me as special looking back I

feel like it marked itself that it drew

my eye and I would stare at it for

longer than the other boxes piled up

around his house the place was so quiet

a lonely testament to Christopher's

isolation he'd never married and there

seemed to be nothing in that dingy home

that said he had any friends to speak of

in a lot of ways it reminded me in my

own life I have friends enough in

Norwich but no family except Christopher

and my parents though I do have my

reasons still looking through my late

brother's things led to the sort of

reflection that makes me uncomfortable

and I was drinking more than I normally

would

it was my second day down there when I

opened the box I've been going through

all his old document boxes and there

were a lot Christopher had worked for

the history department at the University

of Southampton I don't know what he

specialized in we never really talked

about his work but based on what I found

in his study he'd written a few books on

the subject of ancient myths and

fetishes those objects that were

believed by various cultures to have

supernatural or religious power imbued

with in them his first book was on the

holy cross of Christianity and how it

operates as a fetish within our culture

this offended me a little bit

I was worried he was trivializing a

faith that as far as I knew he shared

with me still I tried to read a chapter

of it on the use of the cross in the

vampire myth but it was very dry and

quite frankly a bit dull most of the

boxes were similar full of notes and

clippings and bits of research that

meant absolutely nothing to me I put

these aside to check with Angus

Cartwright one of Christopher's

colleagues who I had contacted to have a

look at what papers of his I couldn't

understand some of the boxes however

contained what I can only assume was

practical research fetish objects and

totems from all around the world small

animal figures carved from bones strings

of glass beads tied together in

intricate knotted patterns grotesque

quasi human statuettes made of wood an

old leather some of them were more than

a little bit unsettling but only one

managed to send me spiraling into the

place I am now as I said it was one of

the last boxes I opened on the second

day it was late and I had already made

my way through most of a bottle of wine

the more I think about it the more I

think that opening that box felt no

different to any of the others no hard

feelings no smells nothing he was just a

box empty of everything except a single

type written note and an old hand mirror

it lay inside utterly innocuous if it

was a trap there was no way to tell I

picked up the note first the typing was

neat managed to be completely centered

even though the paper seems to be a

scrap that had been torn from a larger

piece it read in all capitals behind you

I'm sure you don't need me to tell you

how unsettling that was I turned and

looked almost before I fully understood

what I had read there was a window

behind me with the view of the street

below my brother's study and the

darkening sky above it there was nothing

there though nobody walking along the

street no cars driving down it nothing

that seemed in any way out of place I

looked back at the note shrugged and

reached down for the mirror it was a bit

heavier than I'd expected and under a

thick layer of tarnish the frame seemed

to be gold or at least gold plated the

glass itself was a bit grimy but still

seemed to be intact

I have no idea how old it was or what

period it might have been made and

though I searched the box thoroughly I

couldn't find anything that might

explain where Christopher got it I

looked in the mirror I was a mess hair

unwashed eyes red from crying lips

patchy stained a bruised purple from the

wine I hadn't really had any time to

take care of or even look at myself

since I got to Christopher's house and

this ancient hand mirror really showed

it I sighed shook my head and prepared

to check the next box when the angle on

the mirror shifted in my hand slightly

and I screamed it now reflected the

window behind me and I could see a face

staring in it was dark outside and it

was almost entirely in shadow so I

couldn't tell you much about the

features but he was huge seeming to take

up most of the window behind me the only

thing about it that I could see with any

real clarity were the eyes bright

shining bulging eyes with pupils so dark

it made me feel sick drinking everything

in watching with a greedy intensity I

could feel its gaze burning into the

back of my neck feel its unblinking eyes

my muscles locked in sudden terror and

the mirror tumbled out of my hand

spinning only once before it hit the

floor and shattered into a thousand tiny

shards

seven years bad luck isn't it maybe

that's it maybe I have to feel this

horrid aching panic of the eyes I know

of following me for seven years before

they finally leave I hope not but maybe

even that's wishful thinking maybe this

is now my life forever and it will never

ever stop I've tried to think whether

I'd be able to go on if that was the

case I think I'd try at least until my

parents passed away I couldn't stand for

them to lose both children obviously

that was when my real problems began I

could write the face off as a brief but

horrid hallucination but the feeling of

being under constant scrutiny and

observation isn't something I can

explain away so easily I've considered

the possibility that I'm just going

insane being watched is not an uncommon

symptom of psychosis or schizophrenia

and I've been keeping an eye out for the

other symptoms but in all other ways I

feel fine it's true I'm finding it hard

to concentrate but that's only because I

can't sleep because they're watching me

those unseen eyes that hover everywhere

and won't let me rest I'm not mad I'm

sure I'm not mad I still have what's

left of the mirror it's just a bent gold

frame now I tried to have new glass put

in but the only eyes it showed were mine

I did talk to Angus though he seemed a

little bit unnerved by the line of

questioning I was pursuing or maybe just

by how intensely I was asking the

questions but he answered me he didn't

recognize the mirror but a few years ago

Christopher was looking into writing a

book on the totems of what he called

outer cults small organized groups of

worshipers whose beliefs weren't simply

deviations from paganism or other major

religions but seemed to focus on holy

beings or concepts completely apart from

what would be considered normal

religious practice some seemed to have

more in common with ancient shamanism

than with organized hierarchical worship

and all were highly secretive

Christopher had apparently collected

several artifacts considered holy by

certain of these sects though I could

find no details among his documents

Angus couldn't be sure but he believed

that the mirror might have been one such

object Christopher had apparently

abandoned the project about a year

before his death choosing instead to

pursue a line of Rhys

in two inuit ceremonial carvings and

here's where we finally come to why i'm

here because i anchors told me that my

brother wasn't researching alone he had

apparently logged several trips to

London in order to consult with your

Institute I don't know why or what about

and no one here seems to be able or

willing to help me find out but he was

here I'm not going to rest until I find

how why not that I could rest anyway

those eyes still haunt my dreams and

follow me through the waking world even

here especially here statement ends a

bit of an odd oneness the mid late

twentieth century seems marginally

better filed the most of the archives so

we haven't seen as many rogues

statements cropping up from that period

most of the details from his Myers

statement seem to check out Sasha got a

confirmation from the BBC that she had

indeed been one of the anchors for the

Look East Evening News between 1970 and

72 until she suffered a nervous

breakdown and damaged several cameras in

their Norwich studio martin's checking

with the University of Southampton also

seems to confirm the details of

Christopher Myers life and death I even

tried to read one or two of his books

but they were a bit dry even for me and

Inter pared to have any particular

relevance to the case I've been unable

to locate any evidence that he made use

of the Institute's library or

consultation services but even these

days those records aren't kept in as

much detail as they really should be so

that doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't

here what's most interesting is what Tim

found out about the final two decades of

Miz Myers life before she died in prison

in 1993 following the statement she

apparently spent almost 12 years working

low-level service jobs until both her

mother and father passed away of cancer

and heart disease respectively

there's nothing notable about this

period in any official records but on

October the 24th 1984 she murdered a

delivery van driver named Danilo Kostich

she unloaded the Vans normal cargo of

filing paper and envelopes before

filling it with several barrels of

petrol she was apprehended just south of

Vauxhall Bridge after she jumped a red

light and collided with another car

luckily the petrol did not ignite and

she was picked up by police as she tried

to flee the scene originally charged

with reckless dry

it didn't take long for them to connect

her to the murder of mr. Kostich and she

was given a sentence of 17 years in HMP

Holloway she died of pneumonia nine

years later a bizarre and apparently

motiveless crime the one detail that

still nags at me is that the company the

Danilo Kostich worked for paper run

Limited is the same company that at the

time supplied most of the stationery to

the Magnus Institute I have a nasty

feeling about exactly where she was

taking that petrol and recording you

don't mind if I record this I trust well

to be honest that's kind of one of the

things we wanted to talk about this is

an intervention excuse me if you'd

rather it was an official disciplinary

hearing John we can arrange it fine say

your piece we care about you and you've

been rather erratic says the Prentice

incident and we'd really like to not

have to fire you make sure that you're

doing okay I understand I've been a bit

distant recently you were watching my

house followed me on my lunch break I

was lying about a murder that is to say

do you think we killed Gert no it's

maybe maybe you did I don't know John

this is absurd this goes far beyond on

unhealthy work environment I'll admit

it's partly my fault for letting it get

this bad

I should have started earlier you still

don't believe us do you not that I don't

believe you it's just I mean you could

have done it seriously listen to

yourself right we've gone a long way

beyond right Martin there are monsters

out there and I don't know who or where

they are or if any of you if you want me

to trust you then I'm sorry but I need

evidence

here and this is a copy of all the CCTV

from the weaker Gertrude disappeared the

police finally finished cleaning it up

and examining it and returned a copy

there aren't any cameras in the archive

but there are everywhere else including

all of the entrances into the archive

and across all of the feeds it provides

a remarkably detailed account of all of

our movements over that week even yours

and you think this gives everyone an

alibi but police certainly do but feel

free to check it yourself thank you I

will and let's have no more of this

paranoia I've been examining the CCTV

feeds Elias gave me it it does seem to

provide everyone with a solid alibi and

no one is seen entering or exiting the

archives except Gertrude at least not

before Elias goes down and discovers the

blood gertrude own movements are

somewhat erratic and she seems to be in

and out of the archives at all hours of

the day and night at some points looking

rather disheveled that could stand

closer scrutiny later but for now I I

can't quite figure out whether this

exoneration of my colleagues is more of

a relief or a frustration their very

least it seems I have been I have been

rather unfair to them I just hope they

haven't entirely lost respect for me one

thing that does nothing to ease my mind

though is the renewed significance this

puts on the tunnels beneath the archive

as it seems more and more likely that

whoever or whatever is living down there

is the same thing that killed Gertrude

and supplemental
