# DIANA'S TODO
* General design
  - Find all css and modify it to be more simmilar to wbasn website

* Folders
  - _data has season info and links, I need to update it to reflect witherburn correctly
  - _defunct
  - _drafts and _layouts basically have templates, I won't likely need to modify them much
  - Episodes info is in _posts folder
  - _news contains website updates
  - _sass seems to cantain all the css (there is a homestuck file, seems like you truly can't fight the homestuck)
  - _assets has the epub book, and we don't have it here yet so uhm ehm aeaeae
  - css has... more css, how unexpected
  - js doesn't seem to make modifications

* TODO FOR TODOS
  - Check _defunct and _includes
  - Find how content is placed on the pages to see if it needs any modifications due to a different amount of episodes
  - Play around with the files outside of the folder to see what they do
