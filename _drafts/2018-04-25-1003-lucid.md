summary:         "Our **first ever** competition, Rusty Fears, spawned an incredible amount of great entries. After hours of reading and deliberation in Rusty Towers, Alex, Jonny & Anil [announced the winners](http://rustyquill.com/winning-fears/). This week's episode is the first of TWO winning stories written by fans like you and produced by us here at Rusty Quill.\n\nWithout further ado: \"Lucid\" is written by **Elizabeth Richardson** and read by Jonathan Sims. Listen in next week (and then keep listening of course) to catch the next winning story!\n\nNote: this is a stand-alone piece of fiction and not part of the Magnus canon."
