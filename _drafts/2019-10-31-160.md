everything all right 

just making sure it works 

still don't think we should have brought it 

oh it's better than no warning at all 

especially if I'm trying not to see things you know 

I guess

you're unpacked then 

hmm

oh yes 

much as I can without any wardrobes to speak of 

at least yet 

it's not exactly the Ritz 

well it technically still belongs to Daisy so I'm just glad it's not some sort of kill room 

Oh oh it is and she just cleaned it up

really 

well 

yes 

are we are we safe here

safe is anywhere else 

if Elias wanted to find us I imagine he could 

but I doubt the police will be able to 

if nothing else 

I'm hoping there'd be some jurisdictional complications in Scotland

somehow I don't think Daisy will be worried about jurisdictions 

I I don't think she'd come here 

doesn't know why this place has been used to for years

and if she does well 

at least we'll know where she is

besides I'm more worried about the other hunters or the Sasha thing 

last I heard they still hadn't found any bodies 

a lot of destruction a lot of blood 

that's it

you think 

missed them out there

hopefully a long way out there 

I think

we're okay

not much in the way of food is there 

oh no not yet 

I was actually gonna head down into the village to go pick something up 

hmm maybe give basira a call to check in cuz Daisy apparently couldn't pick a safe house from with a signal 

I think that's rather the point

mm-hm

anyway don't tell me the phone box down there doesn't appeal to your retro aesthetic 

it might 

maybe

you'll be okay here 

I'll be fine 

how was she

same as last week 

Institute still crawling with police 

I mean they finished all the interviews 

apparently they're calling it a terror attack 

don't surprise me 

appropriate in a way 

does she know who they're looking to blame

I'm not really talking to her about it 

a section or not I guess ex-police only gets you so far

does she know if they found the old prison yet the panopticon 

a lot 

Magnus's body 

how hard they're looking to be honest

Basira says a few of them got lost in the tunnels for over a day 

and it's not like the promise of an old man's corpse is much of a motivator and

still she did manage to talk him out of burning the whole place to the ground

Oh actually that reminds me um ah 

these are the statements 

yes Basira said last week she'd sent some up as soon as the archives weren't a crime scene 

this

she wasn't sure which one she'd read already so she she just said she'd send a bunch 

there's tapes in here as well

did she say anything about tapes 

she didn't mention it but I didn't check it till after the call 

hmm 

I assume it's her attempt at a a varied diet 

eating your greens you know 

probably 

I'm sure it'll work fine 

cool 

well 

as fun as listening to you monologue is I will give you some privacy 

there for a walk

let me know if you see any good cows

obviously I'm going to tell you if I see any good cows 

right

statement of Hazel Rutter regarding a fire in her childhood home 

original statement given August 9th 1992 

audio recording by jonathan sims the archivist

statement begins 

hello John 

apologies for the deception but I rather wanted to make sure you started reading 

so I thought it best not to announce myself

I'm assuming all alone

you always did prefer to read your statements in private 

I wouldn't try too hard to stop reading 

there's every likelihood you'll just hurt yourself 

so just listen 

now shall we turn the page and try again 

statement of Jonah Magnus regarding Jonathan Sims the archivist

statement begins 

I hope you forgive me the self-indulgence but I have worked so very hard for this moment 

the culmination of two centuries of work

it's rare that you get the chance to monologue through the voice of another

and you can't tell me you're not curious 

why does a man seek to destroy the world

it's simple enough answer 

for immortality and power 

uninspired perhaps but my god

the discovery not simply of the dark and horrible reality of the world in which you live 

but that you would quite willingly doom that world and confined the billions in it to an eternity of terror and suffering 

all to ensure your own happiness

to place yourself beyond pain and death

and interfere it 

is an awful thing to know about yourself 

but the freedom John

the freedom of it all 

I have dedicated my life to handing the world to these dread powers all for my own gain and I feel nothing but satisfaction in that choice 

I am to be a king of a ruined world and I shall never die 

I believe there are far more people in this world would take that bargain the knew would ever guess 

and I have beaten all of them

of course this desire did not manifest overnight 

when smirke first gathered our little band 

Lucas Scott and the rest 

to discuss and hypothesize on the nature of the things he had learned from Rayner 

I felt what I believe we all felt

curiosity and fear 

but as he compiled his taxonomy and codified his theories on the grand rituals 

I began to develop a very specific concern 

smirke was still so obsessed with his ideas on balance

even as our fellows began to experiment and fall to the service of their patrons

I began to worry that if one of them are successfully attempted their ritual

then I would be as much a victim as any

trapped in a nightmare landscape of a twisted world

but first I attempted prevention 

but the cause seemed hopeless 

the only way to ensure I did not suffer the tribulations of what I believed to be an inevitable transformation was to bring it about myself 

so what began as an experiment soon became a race 

beyond that I was getting old and mortality began to weigh more heavily on my mind 

how much in this world is done because we fear death the last and greatest terror 

I convinced

Smirke to work on Milbank 

leading him to design it was a temple to all the fears in equilibrium 

such than my own modifications to the design of the panopticon

went 

it took years for the dread of the prisoners that passed through to fully suffuse the place 

and I was an old man by the time I made my first attempt to the Watchers Crown 

sat in the center of that colossal eye 

the great ring of cells encircling me like a coronet 

it was flawed  as all Smirke's rituals were and none of the inmates survived as the power I attempted to harness shook the building almost pieces and the murky swamp upon which the prison was built consumed it 

but it left me a gift 

for sat in that watchtower I could see everything

turned my mind to 

it was a dizzying power and one I discovered I maintained even as I found vessels to extend my life 

of course I had to make sure the location was kept under my control while I worked on revising my plans 

and so I moved the organization I had founded to assist in my research down to London and the Institute as you know it was born

I will not bore you with details of my bodies and failures through those intervening years 

suffice to say I kept busy both planning my own next attempts and doing my best to stymie those others who tried

versions of their own 

surely my interpretation of the Watchers crown had been incomplete 

there had been some element of the ritual I had overlooked

it was not until I met Gertrude Robinson that things began to really come into focus

you see the role of archivist has been part of the Beholding for as far back as my research can go 

this isn't uncommon for the powers 

most of the beliefs around them are guesswork and fallible human interpretation 

but there are certain through lines and consistencies that can be spotted regardless of the trappings 

but Gertrude was unlike any other Archivist 

she simply did not care about collecting experiences or compiling the fears of others 

she was driven to stop those who served the powers 

more than once I thought she must secretly be of the Hunt 

but there was never that sick joy in her 

that thrill of predator and prey 

she had simply decided that this was her position in life and went about it with a practicality that even I found disconcerting at times

I once asked her what drove her 

what had started her down that path 

she told me the desolation had killed her cat 

I don't know if she was joking and to be honest I could never bring myself to look into her mind and find out for sure

in any case Gertrude's ruthless efficiency in derailing and collapsing rituals threw into stark relief a question that had been bothering me for almost 150 years 

in the whole span of humanity why had nobody ever succeeded

perhaps there were a long line of Gertrude Robinsons throughout history

but I found that hard to credit 

could it be then that there was something in the very concept of the rituals that meant they couldn't succeed 

she was clearly having similar thoughts in that last year 

all of which culminated with the People's Church 

when I saw that she was making no preparations whatsoever to stop it I realized she was putting into practice a theory 

and once she couldn't afford to be wrong 

she was going to wait and see if the unopposed rituals succeeded 

or it had collapsed under its own strain as mine had all those years ago 

knowing Gertrude I'm sure she had a back-up plan if she had miscalculated

but she had not 

the ritual failed 

and all at once I realized what needed to be done 

you see the thing about the fears is that they can never be truly separated from each other

when does the fear of sudden violence transition into the panic of hunted prey

when does the mask of the Stranger become the deception of the Spiral 

even those that seem to exist in direct opposition rely on each other for their definition 

as much as up relies on down to try and create a world with only the Buried makes as much sense as trying to conceive a world with only down 

every ritual tied itself so closely to a single power as to render itself impossible 

they could bring their patron close but could not sever it from the others 

and eventually it would be violently pulled back to the place 

a next reality where they dwell 

the solution then is simple 

a new ritual must be devised that will bring through all the powers at once 

all 14 

as I had hoped I could complete it before any new powers such as extinction were able to fully emerge

all under the eyes auspices

of course we must have to forget our roots

and there was only one being and could possibly serve as a linchpin for this new ritual 

the archivist 

a position that had so recently become vacant thanks to Gertrude's ill-timed retirement plans

because the thing about the archivist is that well 

it's a bit of a misnomer 

it might perhaps be better named the archive 

because you do not administer and preserve the records of fear John

you are a record of fear both in mind 

as you walk the shuddering dread the beach statement 

and in body 

as the powers each leave their mark upon you 

you are a living Veronica of Terror 

perhaps then if I could find an archivist and have each power mark them 

have them confront each one and each in turn instill in them a powerful and acute fear for their life 

they could be turned into a conduit for the coming of this nightmare Kingdom

do you see where I'm going John 

it does take away that in this world of would-be occult dynasties and ageless monsters the chosen one is simply that someone I chose 

it's not in your blood or your soul or your destiny

it's just in your own rotten luck

I'll admit my options were somewhat limited 

but oh my god when you came to me already marked by the Web I knew it had to be you 

I even held out some small hope he would be sent by the spider as a sort of implicit blessing on my whole project 

and do you know what I think it was 

of course I had to bide my time get a measure of you before I began to push

learn how you worked 

so I decided I would wait until something came for you and see how you reacted 

attacks upon the Archives were not uncommon during Gertrude's tenure 

and while she was always prepared I made sure you would not be 

I reasoned if you couldn't survive a single encounter you were unlikely to make it through all 14 

so when Jane Prentiss attacked I watched 

eat lay one hand on the gas release from the start 

you acquitted yourself well enough so I decided to see how much further he would get 

though I waited until the worms were 

in beautiful lever 

I needed to make sure you felt that fear all the way 

the discovery that one of the Stranger's minions had infiltrated the Institute in the aftermath was certainly a pleasant bonus

even if that sliver of paranoia that they promised you couldn't why place

wouldn't count as a mark 

it was only a matter of time before it confronted you in a far more direct and affecting man

admittedly given the advent of the Unknowing I needn't have bothered 

but what's the old saying about hindsight

more important to me the sashes

encounter with the Distortion 

if 

it had taken an interest that I very much wanted it to cross your path 

so I found one of its current victims and convinced her to make a statement 

poor Helen 

I actually had to put her in a taxi myself she was getting so lost on those narrow London side streets 

it worked though

between the stabbing and at least two desperate flights into its door you're marked very deep by the Spiral

Jurgen Leitner was a surprise of course 

and I was forced to improvise 

I had no idea how much Gertrude would have told him and he could very easily have derailed everything if you learned too much too fast 

I justified it to myself saying I was going to have to send you out into the world anyway if he were going to encounter more of the powers 

but I can't honestly pretend it wasn't a rather rash move 

still I'd requested detective Tanner be assigned to the case when they found Gertrude's body in the hope that having a Hunter in the mix would eventually lead to a confrontation 

and setting you up as a killer certainly hastened that 

then it was just a matter of feeding you statements to lead you to a few avatars I thought were likely to harm you 

but probably would stop short of actually killing you

Jude served her purpose exactly as I had hoped

as did our dearly departed Mr. Crew

marking you for the Desolation and the Vast 

honestly I had nothing to do with Melanie and her Slaughter adventure 

but when I saw the situation I made sure to trap her here 

so whenever her rage bubbled over you were right there 

a ready target 

I didn't foresee the mark coming from surgery gone wrong but it was a very pleasant surprise 

the Unknowing was a distraction but not an unwelcome one 

for this to work you needed more than just the marks 

you needed power and that was something the Unknowing served to test 

though it posed no actual danger in the grand scheme of things 

and it did serve another purpose 

of course it inadvertently pushed him to confront death 

a mark I had been very worried about trying to orchestrate 

if I tried too early you just died 

too late and you might be powerful enough to see the attempt coming and maybe even understand why 

as it was it was just right and once again you came through with flying colors 

by this point your abilities were coming on in leaps and bounds and I was concerned that meeting face to face might end up with you knowing something you shouldn't 

I had initially planned to go into hiding but when your colleagues surprised me with the police well 

it was simple enough to cut a deal 

all that remained then with the Dark, the Flesh, the Buried, and the Lonely

I was a little put out when that idiot Jared Hopworth misinterpreted my letters and attacked the Institute too soon 

before you were even out of the hospital 

but then you should have seen my face when you voluntarily went to him

I couldn't see what happened in there of course 

but given how you came out I'm very sure it counts as a mark 

I suspected the coffin might turn up again 

and once it did it was simply a matter of getting any restraining factors you might have had flying off on a wild goose chase and waiting 

honestly detective Tanner has proven invaluable through this whole process 

I was racking my brains for months about what I could use to lure you in 

and of course I knew the Dark Sun was just sitting there waiting 

so when it came time I whipped up another apocalypse and sent you on your merry way

then all that remained was the lovely poor Peter 

he really should have left well enough alone

what has done what I asked in the first place 

oh well 

he knew what I was attempting and was very unwilling to cooperate until I made him a little wager about Martin 

of course he had no way of knowing that in addition to setting you up for the final mark he was giving you all the tools you needed to escape from it

how is martin by the way 

he looks well

you will keep an eye on him when all this is over won't you

he's a defendant 

and there 

I think we are brought just about up-to-date 

I have enjoyed our little trip down memory lane

but past here knows only impatience 

you are prepared 

you are ready 

you are marked 

the power of the Ceaseless Watcher flows through you and the time of our victory is here 

don't worry John

you'll get used to it 

here in the world

under that we have made 

now repeat after me

you watch and know and understand none

you who listen and hear and will not comprehend 

you who wait and wait and drink in all that is not yours by right

come to us in your wholeness 

come to us in your perfection 

bring all that is fair and all that is terror and all that is the awful dread that crawls and chokes and blinds and falls and twists and leaves and hides and weaves and burns and unsent rips and bleeds and dies 

come to us

Oh John John 

wake up no I 

do

John 

what 

Oh God 

what happened I don't know 

everything 

it's all gone wrong

help me 

oh yeah don't go outside 

it's

it's real

Oh God 

I don't know 

if it's just here 

oh no 

it's everywhere

they're all here now 

I can feel all of it

John I'm scared 

the whole world is afraid Martin

because of me 

and the Watcher drinks it all in 

just look at the sky Martin look at the sky

it's looking back
