#### ARCHIVIST

Statement of Eugene Vanderstock, regarding the creation of Agnes Montague, her life, care, and death. Original statement given November 30th, 2006. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

#### ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

Arthur asked me to tell you that Agnes Montague is dead. He asked me specifically because he knew I'd have to write my whole bloody story down for you and it would hurt like hell 

and I talked out of turn to him 

suggested that we ought to just burn this whole place to the ground with you inside 

so I suppose this counts as my punishment 

he thinks I'm scared enough not to make good on my threats without his say-so

he's probably 

arrived 

just as well you're not here 

smart move on your part

they always are aren't they 

smart moves

someday you're gonna push your luck too far and when you do well you just better hope it isn't Jude who comes to collect

so me I was born in 36 

I know I don't look 70 but burning the candle at all ends does have a few advantages 

until you burn out entirely at least 

it's hard to say how much I've got left in me 

how much longer my sacrifices can buy me 

but when I go you better believe I'm going big and it is going to hurt

you know I got my start in the Blitz 

I remember it like it was yesterday it was 

a Glenn Dunlop's house 

that did it 

you know we were always playing together outside 

sometimes his mom would give us tea 

while it was gone 

nothing but rubble

and and desolation 

Glenn his parents have been in the shelter out back but I guess it wasn't quite sheltered enough

and only his dad made it out 

he was a tall strong man used to work as a stevedore 

and I'd never seen him without a stern expression and a pipe 

but now staggering through the ruins of his life

the look I saw on his face 

it woke something in me 

something truly awful

anyone who talks about the Blitz spirit wasn't there or wants to paper over their fear with nostalgia 

terrible things happened in the blackout and we hurt each other just as much as the Germans hurt us 

and I heard so very many people 

a building fire is a dreadful thing 

but so much more dreadful 

in his shining out into that night 

it was the first of my crimes but not the last 

and arson has always been my thing 

it's such a simple way to destroy everything someone has built both literally and figuratively

I found my God through my own path

served it in my own way 

and when Arthur and Diego found me 

told me there were others that shared my devotion 

well I can't say it doesn't feel nice to belong

even if we do have our little disagreements

and one of those disagreements came down to I suppose you could call it destiny

we all felt the calling 

the dreams pulling us ever closer to a world of fire and loss 

a place of burning and agony when we remade the world in the image of the lightless flame 

the one Diego called a sog 

we all felt it longed for it 

but a longing is not the same thing as an instruction 

we'd all been touched and warped by proximity to the holy burning fire but none of us had any special knowledge 

no matter what Diego claims 

he might have read 

he wanted a grand inferno 

a ritual of apocalyptic burning that would make the firebombing of Dresden look like a sparkler 

which sounded amazing but a few of us pointed out that the Allied air force had a tad more firepower than we did 

as none of us were likely to make the rank of Air Marshal any time soon

and that's when Arthur proposed his own plan 

a chosen one we would create 

a messiah 

the flame incarnate 

one who could usher in this new world and lead us in 

what Diego called the scoured earth 

when we finally decided 

it was

eileen Montague 

who came forward as a volunteer she was five months pregnant at the time and had already taken care of the father in the usual manner of our little congregation 

some objected 

said that unless the child was conceived of the flame it could never be a true incarnation 

but they had no idea of how such a conception could possibly even work 

so it was decided that it would have to be enough 

to birth of the child by fire

we burned down five acres of woodland to create the site 

at the center of the

blackened - covered forest 

we built a pyre so high and strong the flame would be clear for miles 

and so cunningly built it would catch in moments 

before it a great bowl of pure water 

for a SOGs

scolding baptism 

and in the center of the pyre a hollow where 

Eileen 

was to lay 

we prayed and sacrificed and anointed her body with holy oil and a crown of kindling 

I protested the last one but we could do better than to aid the Christians 

but I was shouted down at last 

the hour was at hand and as the first contraction started Arthur struck a match

the fire was so immediate so intense that I was almost brought to my knees

the light of the pyre so bright for a second 

before it turned inwards 

robbed of its glow and comfort turned entirely into blistering and unbearable heat 

he

covered 

I leaned in a second

flesh blackening and cracking lips

parting in a scream that was all at once agony and joy and terror and communion

this 

layer after layer of skin and muscle and bone were one-by-one destroyed by the force of the flames

until at last nothing remained of her but ash and bone 

and on top of that sleeping peacefully among the fire a baby 

untouched unharmed and to our eyes alight with a burning divinity 

we baptized her with the boiling water of asaag 

and named her agnes as had been her mother's final request 

but raising a messiah as it turns out is a lot more challenging than creating one 

the sacrifices we fed agnes worked fine 

and maintaining her as a vessel of the lightless flame proved no real problem at all

but dealing with her as a child was far tougher 

she was quiet 

consider it 

but prone to fits of violent rage which

while not unexpected given what burned inside her 

still made living in a single location for any length of time untenable 

she could not be allowed near 

the children 

for fear of discovery 

could not be left alone for any significant length of time 

and any who were not directly blessed were often unable to survive even an hour in her company 

we even lost a few members whose blessings proved insufficient 

Arthur tried to frame all this as a test of faith and declared that those 

will be 

lost raising agnes had been found wanting in their devotion to the lightless flame 

prick

she was just a brat 

eventually she began to settle down to reach equilibrium and take her lessons more to heart

she became studious quiet seemed to accept and acknowledge her destiny her duties as our chosen one 

and at times she even spoke dreamily of the scoured earth the pain of the world to come 

her strength was growing by the day and even some of our most devout could not touch her for more than a few seconds 

there was some division amongst us as to the best course of action 

something that will surely not surprise you 

at this stage 

some thought she needed to walk among normal children 

interact with those who saw her as one of them 

some thought she needed to continue training her focus 

and some thought we had waited long enough to strike at our enemies and she was powerful enough already 

the compromise we came to was hilltop Road

we knew it was a stronghold of the web

full of other children Agnes's age 

we would supervise from a distance 

but what confidence 

she would be in no danger

the mother of Puppets has always suffered at our hand 

all the manipulation and such venom in the world means nothing against a pure and unrestrained force of destruction and ruin 

we will write 

on that front though 

if we'd known exactly how powerful the web was in that place perhaps we would have reconsidered 

I was not one of those assigned to watch our chosen one so I can't say much about exactly what happened within the walls of that house 

but it seemed to 

fight

scarred the place in a way far deeper than simple fire 

a scar in reality that I believe has since been compounded by the interferences of other powers

regardless the effect 

had

Alagna s-- 

was unanticipated 

as far as we could tell

she had destroyed the place utterly and yet she remained bound to it 

tied to it in some vital way 

I knew when Arthur told me she had kept Raymond Fielding's hand that he was worried 

but none of us could know 

what you were going to do

truth be told I don't know what you 

actually did to do 

neither Arthur nor Diego would explain it to me in detail and Jude simply flies into a rage when it's brought up 

I assume it's why we were waiting biding our time for decades

unable to bring our designs to any culmination 

Jude had only just joined at the time and was besotted with Agnes

though I couldn't tell you if she loved her as a god or as a woman or as both

whatever the situation whatever you did we were left paralyzed unable to go any further with our destiny 

and I was assured unable to remove the impediment

so we waited 

Agnes had reached adulthood but would aged no further 

so there was no worry to that her fire would someday die of course 

but until then it would neither fade nor dim 

we did what we could 

we found her a place to live gave her Jude for a guardian and provided for her material needs 

the years began to slowly burn away my job was to provide for less mundane requirements 

I was to secure her sacrifices 

I would spare you the details but I do not wish to 

I worked in a factory you see 

large furnaces that glow red hot at all hours of the day and night 

eventually enough of my superiors had suffered accidents or injuries that I had obtained a management position 

it was difficult to t

ake the space 

I needed 

and make the necessary adjustments especially without anyone noticing

but eventually I was able to create a small workshop just beneath the main furnace 

it was far too hot for anyone to check so I had my peace 

I took foreign workers mostly 

those with the fewest immediate connections to complicate matters 

and the most hopeful dreams of what their life might be 

they were the ones that provided Agnes the most satisfying nourishment 

I would wait for them to be alone and then I would catch them unawares 

melting their mouths shut was a simple matter and the screams they were able to make with their throat alone were easily drowned out by the constantly roaring machinery 

I would drag them down to my workshop and slowly bit by bit I would melt them 

draining the now liquid fat from their bodies 

that I could later render into tallow

their heart their eyes and their tongue I would scorch down to ash and mix into it for the texture 

or 

the rest I simply incinerated

once fully rendered I would turn these poor souls into foul-smelling candles

the wicks twisted from whatever hair and tendon survived 

didn't ignite with any flame instead burning with a black ember

and if you listened very closely 

you could almost hear screaming 

Agnes would take them to her small empty flat 

lay them on the floor and light them 

over the many hours these candles burned she would crane over them 

so martha tells me

inhaling all the agony suffering and loss from which they were created 

or he could have been lying to me 

just to keep him busy with torture and murder so i didn't get in the way of anything 

I don't think I'd have minded that actually 

at least I felt useful 

aside from that Agnes simply waited 

we all did

but I think it was the hardest on her 

so much fire and destruction trapped raging inside her as she simply sat Placid

waiting for something 

of course none of us suspected what was actually 

going to sink 

at all 

I mean if you told me I'd have laughed at you 

stupid coffee shop twit 

I honestly don't know why Arthur allowed it or why Jude didn't step in

she's usually so jealous 

but Agnes

maybe Agnes asked them to leave him alone 

or maybe they were just surprised by her interest in this boring unremarkable fool 

maybe they assumed it was some long torturous plan she was simply building the kindling for 

a bonfire of aching loss and suffering such as we had never before seen 

and I suppose in a way she was

just not the one any of us expected it wasn't love I'm sure of that 

I don't think he was even happiness 

I think it was doubt 

in that tiny sliver of affection lay a whole universe of doubt

the sort of doubt that the torturing flame incarnate cannot have 

but the too many years spent in silent patience 

followed by one clumsy flirt in a coffee shop 

could create a tiny hairline fracture which destroys everything 

when she told us 

I have known anguish and destruction like few in this world but the memory of that night still makes me shudder 

the sadness and grief we felt 

of what we knew we had lost 

it was Agnes herself that suggested it 

if we tried the ritual and failed she said it might be hundreds of years before we had the strength to try again 

but if she ceased

not in culmination of fire but a cold and quiet death 

perhaps her spark would return to the lightless flame and she could try again 

not immediately 

likely not even within my remaining lifetime

but sooner than if she burned

and so we hanged her as she requested

all because of that most insidious of emotions 

hope 

we have allowed Jude free rein on what happens to the coffee shop boy 

though Agnes asked her not to interfere 

she's not yet harmed him but I cannot imagine what is going through her mind 

the misery and pain he has brought upon himself 

for all her anger she is not rash and I fear her quiet consideration far more than I worry about her temper 

it may be he lives for the remainder of his natural life 

but she will make sure he is never happy and never without pain 

as for you 

whatever you did and whatever protection it might have afforded you is severed with Agnes's death 

Arthur has told us not to harm you yet

but this whole thing has really well the 

weakened his authority

and many of us are now looking towards Diego for leadership 

but we shall see I suppose 

I hope when it is time we may burn you forever

Gertrude

#### ARCHIVIST

statement ends 

nice to see Gertrude also used to get a lot of threats 

so far doesn't seem that any went desperately well 

except for Elias of course 

he didn't threaten did he 

he just did it

I'm curious to see what it was she did to derail this big ritual 

because I'm sure she didn't pay poor Jack Barnabas to fall in love with Agnes 

well 90% sure

no one's come seeking vengeance recently though 

and looking at the details for the British steel plant and Scunthorpe

it does seem like Eugene is still around 

so I can only assume some sort of equilibrium was found

given what happened when I met Jude Perry I'm not in any rush to track him or any of them down myself 

Diego I assume to be Diego Molina who Basira crossed paths with back in her sectioned days 

and Arthur could be Arthur Nolan

though going from the head of a cult to watching over 

Jane Prentiss's our

landlord 

does seem like something of a demotion 

God knows it's not like I don't have my own office politics to keep track of 

the others are doing better

I think Basira is busy doing research for something secretive unsurprisingly but she seems to be adjusting to the new Daisy 

I actually like Daisy now which is a really weird feeling

Melanie is quiet but I think therapy's helping 

haven't seen Helen much 

the door is sometimes there sometimes not 

they haven't locked 

I'm never going to trust it trust her trust it 

and I shouldn't

whatever its relationship to the person who was or is Helen 

assuming that I can ever know its motivations is a mistake

that just leaves Martin 

which 

why were we chosen 

Agnes was created 

crafted with a specific purpose so finely tuned that even a grain of uncertainty threatened the entirety of her being 

but I am so full of doubt it feels like there's no room for anything else

and I'm sure Martin is the same 

is there destiny here bloodlines and prophecies

or did we just stumble into this 

maybe we're the opposite of Agnes

maybe our doubts are exactly what we need if that's the case I'm a an amazing chosen one

don't know how that would work though

I'm just worried about Martin

every other avatar gets to have their feelings burned right out of them but me

I've just got to sit in mine 

I know he said he had everything under control I need to trust him 

whatever he's doing with Peter he's he knows what he's doing

probably 

I just I need him to be okay 

I just do 

if I knew what his plan was if I knew what Peter was doing if I just
